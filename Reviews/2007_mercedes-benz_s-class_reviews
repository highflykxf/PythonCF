Nav with traffic update, New air ride suspension. Automatic folding mirrors. Night ision. Rear seat climate. This car is hot

Amount of leg room, rear heated and ventilated seats, automatic adjustable rear seats, smooth transmission, powerful engine.

Interior and exterior design. Large amount of legroom both front and back. Easy to use computer system. The AMG appearance package really gives the car a killer look.

V12 power

GTS

More interior room than S500. MPG is very good on highway avg approx 26-27 mpg

Acceleration of a sportscar, with backmassage (not avaiable on s65)

Dynamic driving is one of my favorite but the pulse mode needs to be modified to a much stronger one but not to the extent of making the driver fall to sleep.

Everything!

I have to say everything about this car. The styling is phenomenal inside and outside. The navigation or ?Command System? works great, I have my phone book in it and the fact that I can make a phone call by voice commands, change the temperature on my climate control, change radio stations, etc.

The car is an amazing vehicle. If you get this car with the rear sunroof, make sure you get the car in black. It matches perfectly and won't look like a cop car. I had back problems before I got this car. I no longer do. Seats are excellent. Silent strong engine. 

Cornering lamps that come on when vehicle slows to 25 mph. When the turn is over, they fade out slowly. New quick touch lane change feature: just quickly tap the turn signal lever and it flashes 3 times.

Performance, styling, operation of electronics.

Shift lever on column makes using paddles much easier than my 2004 Lexus LS430 which required you to reach down an look to see what you were doing. 0-60 speed.

Dynamiic multicontour front seats, rear camera, and night view assist.

My favorite feature of the vehicle is using command located in the center console. And the navigational system is in my sight as I drive.

Room

Everything is great

Exterior design. Gobs of torque. Whisper quiet. Great sound system.

New COMAND system is easier for me than the old one. Sumptuous seats, effortless acceleration, stunning good looks, buttery smooth ride, reliability

Design inside and out. Great ride. Accessories are super. Navigation is really good and this time much more easy than the 2006.



Ride comfort.

Exterior design

Sound system, ride, engine response. Body style. 4matic and brakes in the icy conditions are the best.

Design, performance, ride, lack of noise. Sound system. Multiple safety features. Bluetooth comptabile telephone. Improved navigation system.

4 Matic, Distronic, rear camera

I love where they placed the phone key pad, and I love the digital speedometer screen. Parktronic is a must

Performs like a sport sedan. Stomping the gas pedal surprises many other heavy footed off-the-liners. Opt for the satellite radio, it's terrific.

The seats, limitless settings. Also driver settings can be set while driving unlike the Lexus.

The fabulous seats, the extremely comfortable ride

The night vision. The NAV has a very large and easy to read screen. I love where they placed the phone key pad, and I love the digital speedometer screen. 

Back seats

I had a S500 . A 1999 model and I loved it. Was not so complated to operate.

Gear shift and radio. Parktronic is a must

Great NAV system, 2 large panorama roofs, massage chairs, Aerodynamic seats(including rear) large trunk, great performance, Keyless go, coffortable cabin, heated and cooled fornt and rear seats, excellent gas mileage for a 604 hp V12. There are a lot more features , but I'm running out of room here.

Command system & telephone feature

My favorite feature has got to be the the digital display of the dashboard, or that the car rases four inches off the ground. A lot of room and a huge trunk.

Drive Dynamic Multicountour Seats w/ massage- These are the best seats of all time. You have to be careful not to fall asleep when the massage is on. I also got "ABC", there is zero body roll and the car is so level, it's amazing. 

I use the back-up camera all the time. The infra-red night vision is useful on country roads. The dual sunroofs provide plenty of light. The "Tucker" turning headlights improve night vision considerably.

382HP power is way more fun to drive than the 302 on the outgoing S500. Keyless go is a feature I always considered as not essential but once you start enjoying the benefits of it, you will never go back to using a regular key again. Voice input on GPS Nav is absolutely fantastic and really works.

Integrated telephone system using cell phone. Voice commands that work; 7 speed trans.; strong, very adequate 8 cyl. engine race tested for 10 yrs.

The command system. It is excellent. Also the advance radar cruise control! It´s incredible!

Panoramic roof, electronic shades, GPS, sirius, rear seat package, automatic folding mirrors, keyless.

Back up camera, night vision, styling, quetness

Great looking. Fun I-drive. Good voice activation. Great screen size and display. Magnificent handling and very fast. Getting 19 mpg in town ... don't know why so good.

The optional parktronic and keyless go are great features available for most mercedes line up. On the S550, the standard seats has lumbar support for the front passenger, it is soo nice with up to 10 level adjustment. Optional ABC keeps the ride smoother than standard ADS. The COMAND responds fast

Style,performance, technology of all operations of the vehicle being controlled by the knob at your finger tips. Leg room in both the front and back is unmatched in any other vehicle. I purchased the "keyless go" which is an incedible feature. No more hunting for keys to start and lock your car. 

The Command system and the audio system is the best ever. Mercedes has made it soo much easier to use compared to the BMW. Audio is at a stunning 600 Watt. The LCD screen in the center swivels left and right with a press of a button. Ambient lighting throughout the cabinet. More legroom in the car

Inside comfort, sound system activated by that handy round dial. phone attached to middle console. sweet.

Night Vision-excellent feature, should be installed in every car. Navigation is further enhanced with easier to use and the little mouse on the armrest (plus phone attached) is my favorite toy.
