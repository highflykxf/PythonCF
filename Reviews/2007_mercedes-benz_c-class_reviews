Rock solid performance on the road and whisper quiet. You are driving a luxury car. The way the car steers is worth mentioning, it is just superb. The car feels like a German Engineered car that has road manners. Different from a BMW less sporty to the feel, chose the MB because of its manners

Rear window sun screen, sensory wipers, sunroof, smart key and decent trunk space.

Styling and handling are the premier characteristics of this car. It will get up at high speeds and "sit" on the road. At 120 mph it handles tightly and rides like 65 mph. Trunk space is fantastic. Sun roof, rear sun shade, and one touch features. Overall driving experience is excellent. 

Build quality, ride, comfort, quiet.

The ride and the way it handles. Plus the mileage is very nice surprise for a 4 awd. 



Body style, wide rear wheels, stereo.

Sporty appeal, interior chrome features, AMG features (exhaust pipe)

iPod hook up and the sunroof, huge trunk can fit like 4 golf bags in there. 

Speed

I love the look of the car and it is a very smooth ride.

Bumper to bumper - a sweet ride.

It's hot. The outside is sleek and the inside is sexy. 

Good gas mileage, very eye appealing to look at, cool features such as automatic rain sensing windshield wipers

The seven speed automatic is great, and it allows you to shift your own gears. It also has a sport/comfort mode switch. I have the base sound system and it has great sound quality with mp3 capability from the changer. The rear power sunshade is great on sunny days. 

Sport exterior, solid handling, FFV, sound system, interior is beautiful & comfortable, sporty feel, telescoping steering wheel, back window automatic sun shade is so cool, all the extras (sun roof), and it overall quality. Love the looks I get when I drive it.

Auto seats, dimming mirrors, sun shade and AMG wheel package

Interior & exterior design, E85 fuel, blue tints, rear shade, very comfortable.

Ouality, interior, huge sunroof, control placement, storage places.

Bi-Xenon lights, 7GTronic transmission, heated seats, AMG exterior styling parts, birdseye maple trim. Quiet ride, excellent braking, and very good handling. Very easy to drive.

Attractive interior with great ergonomics; fake-leather seats feel great and look as good as real leather would; standard sport-package trim (AMG exhaust tips, subtle trunk spoiler, wide wheels) looks good.

Acceleration

I enjoy the sound system, satelite radio for life. Yea I said it, for the life of the car. The handling is unbeliveable and the quickness is just pure enjoyment for the cost. And to think I was about to get an Audi! Got 30.5 MPG on 4.5 hr roadtrip.

The engine and its performance as well as the exterior and interior styling make the C280 MB is an excellent car. The 4 matic version always gives one excellent control of the road, particularly in fall and winter driving.

Smooth and fast acceleration and smart transmission. 

Light grey MB Tex interior with light blue window tint. 10 way position drivers seat with side mirror and steering wheel memory.

Auto-window roll down, smart key, stereo quality, i-pod integration kit

Commanding road view, quick turn in, excellentent road feel, great maneuverability in urban traffic. Excellent inetrior fit and finish, upgraded stereo system. My car is granite grey with AMG accents and looks cool in an understated way to this middle aged man. Over all fun to drive factor

Increased horsepower along with increased gas mileage.

Superb handling. Ride quality. Distinctive and elegant styling. Braking power. (Key) Remote functionality.

Love being able to roll down the windows and sunroof with the key, especially with a black car!

Smooth drive, functions on steering column, looks great

Vehicle key, body style, trip computer, suspension and road handling (it's like driving a go-kart).

4-Matic AWD. Luxury Features, sturdy feeling drive and believe it or not, the power of 225 horses is not bad at all. The gears shift very smoothly and you can also play with tiptronic/manual shift for a more sporty feel. The look (in and out) is very sharp and attracted me (and I'm very picky).

7speed automatic, auto shade, auto adjustable seat. Easy handling.

Exterior styling 

Steptronic, and the Smart key

Heated seats, sound system, navigation system. Very smooth ride.

The automatic rear sunshade is cool.

The exterior lines of this car are beautiful. The electronic rear shade is great when parked in the sun.

I love the Harmon Kardon premium sound, and the manual shifting automatic is fun to drive.



Heated seats, stereo, interior design, handling. Perfect from bumper to bumper.

All the safety features. I get many compliments from onlookers. Satellite radio and sound system. 

E85

The rain sensing winshield wipers that come on automatically once rain hits the winshield. The push button back seat . It lowers the rear head-rest when you need to see the rear view . The push button that lets all the windows down and back up from outside the car .
