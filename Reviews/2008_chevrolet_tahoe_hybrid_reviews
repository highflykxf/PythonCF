Leather seats are very comfortable and the rear camera makes trailer hookup a breeze when you have to do it alone. Love the increased gas mileage, we get 20 to 21 most of the time, we have seen 22 to 23 if we drive around 65 on the interstate, that's hard to do with the smooth ride.

GPS

Truck looks good. Nice electronics inside. OnStar. 

Navigation system. I am directionally impaired. I always get lost.

OnStar, GPS system, good sound system, backup camera, electric outlet at tailgate

Cold A/C while in hybrid mode. 2-mode hybrid system that helps even when in 4WD, and the gas engine is running. More power than standard Tahoe.

On black vehicle - I like the Hybrid stickers - there sharp & advertises the "Green" decision I make as a consumer

Mileage in a vehicle that can still tow my 15' trailer when needed.

Hybrid technogy. I can virtually drive from the main road into my development and to my house on battery power alone.

Mileage that meets/exceeds stated claims. Smooth ride, even over rougher surfaces. Good acceleration and torque at passing speeds. Comfortable interior seats. Attractive exterior design.
