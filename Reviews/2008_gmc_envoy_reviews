6200 lbs towing was great for a 6 banger mid sized SUV. That was offset by only getting 15 MPG. I get nearly 20 in my Dodge Ram.

Comfortable and easy to manuever

Bose stereo, V8 power, 18" polished aluminum wheels, grill, leather, memory seats, automatic rear air suspension, heat and A/C with audio controls in second row.

Exterior style and the honeycomb grille. The leather is soft and the ride is excellent.

Short turning radius.

OnStar rocks

8 cylinder engine and its ability to run on 4 cylinders. XM radio is outstanding as well as the Bose sound system.

Interior trim and handling. Seeing the tire pressures displayed in the driver information display is a great feature!

Sunroof and very comfortable when driving.

Interior style and design. Rear passenger climate control. OnStar.

The air compressor in the back and the wood grain in the interior.

Seating, styling, smooth & quiet ride. Comes ready for towing.

Leather power seats with 2 position memory works with both remotes. V8 power with the fuel economy of a V6

5.3 V8, look & feel of leather & woodgrain interior

The interior design is gorgeous!! I feel so comfortable and the interior is so luxurious. The car is an amazing value for the price. I reccomend to anyone to purchase this.
