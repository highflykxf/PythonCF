Price. Leg and head room, handling, smooth running 4 cylinder. Lots of pep. Loads of great extra features you would expect in a higher priced vehicle.

Strong 2 liter motor, not too hard, comfortable seats, good quality mechanically, good styling, smooth cvt transmission, great MPG I'm getting 30+ combined.

Bluetooth, keyless entry are the ritz. Very pleased with the quiet ride and power of car.
