3 rows of full-size seats (six adults fit comfortably).

Integrated: Phone & Ipod hookup. Panoramic roof, fold flat 2nd & 3rd row seats. ETC ETC

seats



Panoramic roof, 4-matic, built in everything, 6 seats for real adults! Diesel power rules

Roominess, front and rear parking sensors, power rear hatch, diesel engine power and mpg.

Roomy, quiet, and smooth. Great interior quality and fit and finish. Good mpg for its size and intention. Good stereo.

Four wheel drive, quality finishes, seats for seven, panaromic roof, wide entry for passengers

Back area ride- I have large dogs so they ride in comfort and I do not have to five up back seat or gas use in the bigger vehicles. Car generally rides smooth and economical of gas, especially the highway

The trunk. I love the automatic open and close feature. The panoramic sunroof is cool too.

The panorama sunroof gets attention to everyone who rides in the car and also the smooth ride the R350 gives is a highlight.

Drives well in almost all weather conditions. Very comfortable for all passengers on long trips. 

Quality, drive and handling, front end design, mileage, power, 7 speed trans. I love the xenon headlights

I like the integrated radio/phone system.

Functionality, looks, fit and finish, sunroof, bluetooth, navigation, rear dvd player

Comfortable seating and entering/exiting for everyone. Great A/C and sound. Subtle seat belt reminder (I love this!). Good stowing capacity with seats down. Gorgeous looks. Better than expected gas mileage. Awesome moon roof. Glad to not have sliding doors. Love the auto trunk release.

Cabin controls are very nicely set up. BlueTooth works well. 

Panoramic roof, satellite HK radio, ride quality, powerful V8, did I mention ride quality!

Comand system takes getting used to but actually works pretty well. Seats are outstandingly comfortable and car (Barolo Red) gets lots of looks

Panaranic roof lets in the natural light and/or plenty of air. Love the interior design. I like the comand center with DVD navigation, audio, satelite etc. Though not touch screen, I don't see it as necessary. The interface is easy to understand. Like that you don't see many on the road.

Driveability, interior comfort, Good HVAC and radio.

Diesel engine is QUIET. Interior space. Seats. Ride. Variable auto wipers. Parktronic.

Seating capacity.

Captain's chairs in second row and the best seats one could ride in! More leg room than I thought possible, panoramic sunroof, quiet ride. While I miss the initial "punch" of my Jeep's V8, the V6 has great power and I am getting better gas mileage than before.

The interior is comfortable and makes longer rides more enjoyable.The legroom in each row is enviable by any other car in its class. My kids love the 2nd row captain's seats. There's so much cargo. New shifter is neat, takes some getting used to. Hope I dont drop my transmission

Panaromic roof, satellite radio, easy to engage cruise control, stereo sound, smooth ride. Better fuel mileage with diesel. Interior room. Dual climate control. Weatherband radio. Electric rear door. Very comfortable seats.

Navigation, stereo sound, smooth ride, seating for 6, inside looks of the car, comfortable seats, safety features, reading light, no oil change until 13,000 miles. 

Panorama roof! Getting 28.6mpg in mix highway 70ish biased driving of a big 5000lb vehicle.

Navagational System, easy bluetooth integration, my harmon kardon sound system, and the panoramic windows. Love that sun. Smooth cruiser with sport and comfort settings..

Fuel economy and power of the diesel engine, interior space, overall quality.

Styling shrinks the true size of the vehicle. High speed cruising isn't something that you normally would want to do in a six passenger car, but this car wants to do it. The best way to cover large distance in great comfort and without worrying about gas sorry diesel bills.

Panoramic sunroof, qualtiy, comfort and the fun "Party Bus" feeling when traveling with many people. Although not fantastic on fuel, when you figure you don't need two cars anymore, you may be actually saving gas in the end. My insurance also dropped almost $125 a month!

Interior all around, vehicle ride and handling, panoramic sun roof, sound system, diesel engine performance, good MPG, parktronics. 

Lines are exotic. Love the shift and paddle shifter

The large sunroof and the comfort in the siiting area and ride.

Electric paddle shifter, with additional shifter on wheel. Panoramic moonroof. Very roomy interior, Good stereo and NAV. Nice auto tailgate. Mid seat A/C and heated rear seats for the kids.
