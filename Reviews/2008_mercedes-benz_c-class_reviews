Design, cruise control, stereo, handling, pretty good all around.

Multimedia package - love the navigation, Harmon Kardon stereo and the ability to rip CDs to the hard drive. I could spend all day listening to music in the car. The iPod adapter is great too because I can scroll through all my playlists and songs by name.

My model came with the entertainment package and completely loaded. What can I say but that you are really missing out if you don't include the great technology offered...DVD... upgraded speakers, iPod integration...etc...

Panorama roof. Sound system. The way the screen pops out of the dash. Easy to use buttons and clean looking interior (the Audi A4 had wayyy too many buttons). It's an extremely comfortable drive.

Shift very nicely. Great brakes and love the satelite.

Overall looks, smooth ride, and general appearance of inside and outside.

New NAV system, Looks in Sport/AMG wheel trim, Color Palladium Silver, Polished Aluminum wheels resist black brake dust vs. the other silver painted wheels that scar easily with the dust buildup. Wood is much better looking than Alum trim in C300 Sport. 

Exterior design is cute. 

Panorama Sunroof, Audio is great, temperature control in seats is precise, Ipod connectivity, love the interior, superb performance in "S" mode. Styling, over all size, Bluetooth option, comfortable seating roomy, Nothing says Classy like a Mercedes Benz no matter what class you drive

New C-Class exterior design. Media Center

Navigation system, voice recognition, and handling for entry level luxury vehicle

Cruise control, overall COMAND function is great - NAV, Sirius radio, 6 CD changer, internal hard drive and memory card, as well as bluetooth phone control are great!

Styling, the car looks much more expensive then it is, also it is quiet for an entry level Mercedes Benz

Everything. Radio is nice. New climate control's 'Off' button which was missing from older C and new BMW. Big buttons help a lot.

DVD/Nav system is great. No touch- screen or buttons on the dash... convenient mouse type device at the front of the arm-rest. Great sound system and voice command/blue tooth makes me feel like James Bond. 

Sirius radio, panoramic sunroof, heated seats, 2nd row fold flat seats, 

Body style is very sporty. I like the features on the body, amg package, rims, spoiler, etc.

The bluetooth, speedometer gauges & info screen, exterior styling.

Bluetooth, Nav, Harmon Kardon 450 Watt sound, wonderful interior appointments, solid quality build, numerous safety features.

Panoramic roof (have to get it!), Power fold in side mirrors, Bi-Xenon headlamps, cornering foglamps (very cool), fold down rear seats (no Lexus sedan has those!) handsfree bluetooth, AMG wheels and AMG front, rear, side body kit

Everything exterior, quiet cabin and ride, grille and front end

Looks and features of the car - we love the Sirius radio and Tele Aid.

Taught suspension, no-nonense teutonic cabin, very intuitive computer interface, bluetooth, very responsive engine and transmission, back seat actually fits two adults.

Bluetooth phone, 6-speed stick, beautiful interior, solid build, infrequent maintenance, spirited performance. 

Bluetooth

Excellent seating positions; radio controls make sense and the viewing screen is large,very readable. 7 speed auto transmission is flawless.

The brakes are fantastic and the sound system is great. For what you are paying the interior is a lot nicer than the BMW. Spring for all of the bells and whistles. You won't regret it.

Everything is just apt

I enjoy the handling ability, the braking and shifting of the vehicle. The transmission is smooth and has decent acceleration for a 3.0. You don't really feel as if you are going 90 the car is so smooth.

Exterior design, best heated seats in the buisness, 3 memory power front seats with memory mirrors and auto folding with lock up. Harmon Kardon sound system. No gimmick rain sensor wipers. Smooth tranny. Great looks and performace for the price, it's nice to have a car that looks like the family.

Toggle control on the console and steering wheel limit reaching all over the place to make adjustments. Test drove BMW, Audi and Volvo, for the money, it was an easy decision for me. 

Quite nice ride. Entertainment package, navigation, harman kordon sound system. AMG wheels look very hot! Steel gray looks awesome. Brakes, handling. Engine sound when you push the limits!

DVD-NAV, engine, power seats, moonroof and windows are pressure-sensitive to prevent injuries. 

Bluetooth, great stereo

My favorite is the engine. Look under the hood, and you'll notice a ram air induction system. Look at the front disc, and you'll notice cross drilled rotors with huge calipers grabbing those rotors. The 7-speed transmission is nearly industry leading, and aluminum pedals is really cool. 

Better/lighter steering, closer/easier to press accelerator, auto door locks/lights, rain sensors & digital speedometer. Solid, vault-like feel/ride.

Safe! Great family car if you want something stylish and fun to drive. 

Bluetooth phone, stereo including Sirius sounds great. Lease was a great deal. Much better gas mileage than my Jag XJR, but not as fun to drive.

Almost everyting about this car is one of my favorites. When I get in the car and the seat, mirrors and steering wheel are adjusted, it feels like a tailor made suit that was custom made just for me. Every control and switch is in perfect reach, exactly where it should be.

This new C300 is making me just as grateful I chose another Mercedes Benz. These machines are really at the top of their class. I drove the Lexus, the BMW, and the G35. For me, I was always comparing them with handling, and styling. MB won again!

Build quality - very solid car. The iPod integration kit. Steering wheel controls. Handling with sports suspension

The mean front grille, xenon headlights, loud speakers, very cool navigation, 18 in. AMG wheels, fold-in mirrors,

Exterior styling, especially front grille and side body contours. Interior design is top shelf. Auto-detect bluetooth mobile phone feature rules. Rear-seat room blows the competition away, adults can actually ride in the back.



It's sad to say the best part of this car is the driver's seat is comfortable.

Styling! Best looking vehicle in the class. Build quality is exceptionally high. Also, handling, performance and fuel economy. Stereo system and the command center are very easy to use. Great fuel enconomy for the engine size (and my style of driving).

We love the fact that the side mirrors turn in when locked and/or manually when desired. Love the blue tooth and access to volume on the steering wheel. Also love the heated individual seats and temperature controls as we are never on the same page as far as body temperatures.

Looks, xenon headlights, mirrors that move inward, Sirius radio.

Exterior design

P2 package and the 7 speed automatic 

The aggressive styling, AMG bodywork, quiet, solid and well composed chassis, nice exhaust sound. Also, it comes standard with a Sunroof, Bluetooth, and power seats. I also love the optional iPod integration.

The front of this car looks really aggressive.

Multimedia package. 18 inch AMG rims and tires. The small details. Like how the hand rest doesn't bang against the interior roof, but retracts softly. How the 5 holes in rear tail lights control airflow around the car to a flow into a nice stream behind the car. 

Manual mode; fun to play around the 5000 rpms. Harmon kardon sound system is good. Leather is beautiful. Navigation is easy to understand and cool to look at as you drive. The engine isnt a feature, but I can't stress how much I like the acceleration. 

Love the steering radius, the seats and the outside appearance of the design. Enjoyed the pick up when needed. On the highway the mileage was better than I expected.

Material quality, fit & finish, power, ride, lighting design (inside & out), bluetooth, GPS, radio (all segments), surround sound, 18" amg wheels with high performance tires (ride & handling is unbelieveable)

the wheels and excust and the new wide body

Exterior look spectacular. Interior design stunning. Handles like a Mercedes. 

Quiet ride. Easy maneuvering and tight steering. Holds the road and is a nice heavy vehicle.

Easy to park, easy to drive, smooth ride, holds the road well, and good daytime visibility. The satellite radio and bluetooth interface for hands free cell phone use are fun. 

Nav, Sirius, multimedia package. Smooth/quiet ride, 

Panarama roof, Ipod, bluetooth 

The command center navigation. Pops up out of the dash and then dissapears.

Great ride, premium stereo system, bluetooth, nav is super. Gas mileage very good for AWD

Fantastic looks, good acceleration, comfort, keyless go option and parktronic option.

Ride characteristics. Solid build quality. Interior layout and exterior styling.

Handling, satellite radio controls, clear and logical displays, hot looks.

Multimedia sound system, panorama sun roof, exterior looks, the total package

Great bluetooth, and great headlamps option. Wish I had brought the gps option. Love the 6 month Sirrus radio, who needs an I-pod or cd's.

Exterior look, multimedia sound system, smooth drive, nice size trunk for a relatively small sedan 

The nav screen, the amg trims on the car. It's a delight to look at. Drive it and you're an absolute fan! 

The handling supurb! I live in the Catskill Mountains, and really push the bar with the suspension, and It performs right to task!

Multimedia features, pop-up navigation screen, voice control, and body styling!!

Exterior design and curves. Harmon sound system is awesome. Fast. 

Bluetooth, Ipod hookup, hard drive, interior and exterior style.

It's a Benz! The redesign is a great step up from previous models (ie - lack of American design influence is a huge plus). The options are reasonably priced comared to competition.

Fold-down rear seats and panorama roof (option package II); excellent power and handling in curves etc.

Interior, MMedia, overall look of car. Love the added protection for the Car (Perma Plate) and Perma Plate Window protection..keeps the car looking new both interior and exterior

I love the 4-Matic here in the Northeast and really love the AMG sport styling

Sport package, sport rims, sound system, quiet cabin and options for enjoying music

I like how it kicks into gear, the panarama sun roof, interior, all the features. 

Built in Sirius and bluetooth is best

Multimedia package, 4matic, xenon headlamps, great build quality. I have been stopped quite a few times since I owned this vehicle by people wanting to know about it and have received many compliments on it.

Bi-Xenon lamps, AWD system, engine performance, ESP/suspension/braking systems, steering wheel/seat/mirror memory, stereo, seats, exterior styling cues, dimming mirrors, birds eye maple trim, interior lighting options, Bluetooth... I like em all.

The front profile is attractive. It has some of the toys that people like such as nav and heated seats.

Quiet ride, appearance & 2 tone grey/black interior, sunroof in up vented position somehow doesn't let one drop of water in while driving in downpours, automatic self-leveling head lights, automatic wipers, great ergonomics & comfortable heated seats, decent mpg for such nimbleness, ashtrays, all good

 

The voice activated navigation system, Bluetooth integrated phone, Bi-xenon headlamps

The MultiMedia option. Being able to use the PCMICA slot to listen to music from the PC. Power, safety. ESP is amazingly accurate. 

Four wheel drive, I am from Chicago, happier than most of my friends in winter. Bluetooth and command based audio, better electronics. Well priced ( compared to BMW of same capacity) Exterior is superb, also it is a run down from previous CLK and S classes. More bang for the buck. Great handler

Smooth ride and very comfortable seating..you can adjust the seats just right. Guages are very good. Harmon Kardon stereo has very good sound. Gas mileage is very good. Good pick up but definitely not a speed demon. Exterior styling is gorgeous. 

Wet handling, beautiful looks, solid Mercedes ride.
