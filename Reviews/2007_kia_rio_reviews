It's exterior design is very pleasing to the eye. Cute lil thing. Large trunk for such a small car. **Most importantly, the warranty that I got with the car (nice plus).

Small sporty size and handling.

Exterior design



Nice sound system for stock. Comfortable and smooth drive. GREAT on gas. Body styling is not bad at all.

The gas mileage

Exterior appearance, great mileage, good interior room.

I like everything about this car (except the cup carrier and the inability to find a blank key to have duplicates made).

Fun to drive. Great mileage.

Looks and the 4dr hatch body.

Price and gas.

The design inside and out. It doesn't look like all the other cars on the road. Unique front and rear design. The sidelines are a thing of beauty.

The peppy engine and good suspension coupled with the 5 speed makes it a blast to drive, and steping on the gas doesn't seem to affect the economy that much. I regularly get 32-33 mpg with about 75% highway, with the awesome AC on as well.

The sound system and the really great air conditioner.

I love the price, warranty, and driving it on windy mountain roads.

This car handles very well, on the highway or not. It takes corners very well, and to emphasize the gas mileage, 35 MPG.

The interior design and the roominess of the hatch back.

10 year 100 thousand mile warranty. The peppy 1.6l 4cyl motor has a lot of get up and go. The suspension feels great and helps my Rio5 hold the road.



Auto transport. CD player.

The look is great and the space is just nice for 5. The noise insulation is not expected for a budget car.

The room and the 6 airbags. Also the warranty, you can't beat it. Plenty of get up and go with good MPG.

My Subs that I added and the gas mileage.
