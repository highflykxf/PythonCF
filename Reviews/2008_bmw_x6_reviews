400 horse power and active steering, oh my!

No braking for turns with the x-drive! Smart technology throughout as usual from BMW. Head-turner. Great acceleration and quiet high speed ride.

The HUD (heads up display) is not only cool but keeps your eyes where they need to be, handling, styling and did I say styling.

Navigation with suggested alternative routes around accidents very handy. Slap shifter and manual shift options are fun to use. Very solid feel and good weight is evident. Car is not small for sure which I like actually.

Good seats. Handling.

The iDrive is a hit with me and any passenger, I like the way my iPod and Smart phone seamlessly integrates into the system. The sound from the speakers is excellent. The Power and the spontaneous acceleration is is a treat, the handling around corners makes this car so fun to drive.

High technology package, comfort access, styling. Sport Package with 150 mph speed limiter. 20" wheels. Even the fog lights alternate illumination when turning into a curve. The 6 disc DVD changer. Real time traffic navigation is a real Godsend.

High technology. Handling. Styling. Comfort. 

Still design and handling. It's so much fun to drive!

Design, "fusion of the X5 and the coupe", handling, performance.

Styling, quiet and comfortable interior, handles more like a sport sedan than the X5, which is already pretty good. Comfort seats are worth the cost. Ventilated, active seats are not worth the money. 

Style, driving position, feels powerful, not so bad gas miles, lots of good gadges inside.

Good workmanship. Even 35 is powerful enough.
