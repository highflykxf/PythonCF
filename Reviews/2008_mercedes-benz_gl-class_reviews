PROS: I?ve owned her now for 2 years, she has 70,000 miles and I still love this car despite these issues.I love the ride, lots of interior room and I get better fuel mileage that was stated! 

gas mileage

- Power/handling - Styling - Comfort/size - 

Towing capacity and rear folding seats

Acceleration and fuel consumption with diesel. Ride quality. Interior styling and front end exterior styling. Comfort of heated leather seats. 3rd row seats fold into floor.

NONE

Sirius/XM radio, windshield washer button, front ambient lighting, the sound of the diesel engine when you punch it, the red button that sometimes closes the lift-gate, the sound of the nav. in Spanish, the white stitching on the black leather interior & dash, big brake pedal, excellent high beams

Self leveling, paddle shifts, the torque of the engine is incredible. All electric features first quality.

Ride comfort, handles like a much smaller vehicle, interior stitching on black interior, standard features and even 2 years later is still somewhat exclusive. You don't see yourself coming and going.

Smooth ride, quiet, all features, large tires, reliability, concierge service. Acceleration is unreal.

Fantastic fuel economy for a people mover.

Style comfort and the navagation system which does not work in Alaska. Nice to look at parked in the garage. 

Nav, air conditioning and heat when I am away from car

Our favorite features include the safety features, style inside and out, powerful V-8, ride comfort, multi- contour seats, Mark Levinson stereo, i- pod connection, backup camera, DVD player, and the overall feel at highway speeds. Plus it is easy to manuever around town.

The interior design is what sold us. The big Lexus looked like a South Florida sunroom. We love the dashboard design and stitching, and the firm seats.

Headlights are incredibly bright. Keyless go is very nice. AC cools down from 110 to 68 in 10 min. (live in Arizona)Suspension is great. Engine is fast and fuel conservative, quiet. Interior lighting is plentiful. Rear seat entertanment is good. Safety features aregood. Park assist is helpful. Great car in features

Smooth, quiet ride. Backup camera. Solid, tight feeling of vehicle. View over hood from drivers seat and lack of blind spots. Exhaust note outside vehicle. Leather quality, fit and finish is superb compared to Q7. Safety rating and air curtains all the way back to the 3rd row seating.

Air suspension makes for a great ride, design is beautiful inside and out, keyless go (must get!), nice leather seats

Unexpected great feature in Texas heat is IR glass (Premium 2 Package). This feature leaves vehicle about 18 degrees cooler on entry which is huge in parking lots on 100 degree days.

Comfort, design and build

Suspension, electronics, and fuel economy

The power hatch, the remote windows down and up. Well made and well thought out.

Navigation, automatic fold down 3rd row, power tailgate, comfort, ride, pickup speed.

3rd row seats, power liftgate, great stereo, styling, power, and ride

Ipod, satellite radio, DVD, nav, power 3rd row, power tailgate, 19th wheel package.

Everything

Stability control, transmission, 4matic, air suspension, rear camera

Aside from the obvious, which is the good looking exterior,my favorite feature is the absolute comfort inside this car and the ease of handling it. It just screams first class.

The keyless-go option is very convenient. 

The diesel motor that allows a big suv to get 25 plus mpg and have the guts to pull 7500 lbs. I have tried this and it does as it says, also you will notice no noise of a diesel motor. I carry disposable plastic gloves in the door to avoid the diesel smell . Starts right away, no wait no smoke

The performance from the turbo diesel, 398 ft-lbs of torque available at 1600rpm!

Ease of handling and great mileage and interior 

Ride is sporty but comfortable. Interior is close to perfect. In the Capri Blue color with a tan interior, it is absolutely gorgeous.

The ride is quick and smooth. It is a solid feel with superb handling. Terrific features - so many that you feel quite spoiled in this car. Can operate so many features from the steering wheel. I love rear camera and front/rear sensors.

Diesel fuel economy, iPod integration, space, and comfort. 

Performance of the 320 CDI diesel compared to my Yukon XL. Load leveling pulling the boat. Large wheels and tires. The Nav system satellite radio. Folding mirrors. Electric third row seats. Electric back lift gate. Rear back up camera. Amazing off road 

Beautiful interior design with stitched dash and wood accents. Comfortable seats. Real 3rd row. Power 3rd row seats and tailgate. Satellite radio, Nav, and Bluetooth are very cool. Combo of 7 speed transmission and diesel torque drives like silk.

Navigation, seat comfort and position, refinement and quietness. Also this large vehicle handles like a car and provides a very secure environment.

I lke the styling better than any car I've ever owned with the possible exception of a 1970 mustang Mach One. It's upgraded killer sound system rivals the Mark Levinson in my 2007 Lexus LS460. The comfort seats adjust to an ideal position for all body types. Power tailgate is great.

The ride quality is superb. The value is unmatched for a company that builds luxury vehicles.
