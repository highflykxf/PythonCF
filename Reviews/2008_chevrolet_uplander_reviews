Spacious

Outside looks



Double slide doors.

Powerful engine, smooth trans, very good radio/CD/MP3 player. Plenty of pep - drives and rides very well. Great visibility. Ample room inside for all.

OnStar, seats are comfy, lots of room. Ride is very comfortable, more like a sedan.

I consider this my conversion van, the front seats are comfortable, it handles fine, we purchased an extended maintenance/warranty and we plan to keep the van for quite sometime.

None!!

The overhead rail system, and powered side doors.

Vehicle is user friendly

Smooth ride, good visibility, pretty good mileage. Pretty quiet ride, but there is a bit of wind noise from the side doors.

Better on gas than I thought. Styling is nice and the price was great

OnStar, leather seats
