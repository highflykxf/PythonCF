Handling,sound system,safety and it does turn heads.

Cupholders are better than in the BMW 328I, full seat pockets not netting, substantial seatbelt arms, memory seats for passenger, smooth ride, great leather quality, great styling, more passenger AC options.

Just a fun to drive car and I have the top down as often as possible. Left it in Florida for the winter months up North, got 28 MPG on the trip back.

Performance & great looks.

Responsiveness, looks, and fun

I would highly recommend getting the 550 over the 350. This stout engine is really worth it. Whether it's from a dead stop or already going 60 on the highway, you always have a ton of power in your back pocket whenever you need it. With its top down, the CLK has few rivals in terms of looks.

interior comfort and high quality leather, great stereo, fantastic handling, a bargain for the performance and comfort, top is smooth and opens and closes quickly, very little windnoise (compared to the 2008 Lexus in the next garage bay that has a lot for a $73K car...Germans are still the best!

Sound system, Mercedes quality and reliability

Transmission, comfort, incredible H/K stereo, fantastic seats, supple leather, tight handling!

This car sounds like no other Mercedes. I love the way the engine sounds when the start button is depressed. Pure fun!

The speed and its spacious cabon. Most coupes are small inside, however, not this one.
