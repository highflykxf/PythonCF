KEYLESS entry!!! It has changed my life. It's better than TIVO. Being a women & not having to search my purse for my key has made my life SO much easier. So many times I have almost gone crazy looking for my keyes. Now I never have to! 



The simplicity of driving this vehicle. Easy to park wherever we go good turning radius. 

I like the appearance of the vehicle from the street and the fact that you don't see yourself coming and going around town. Bright headlamps and fog lights; it's like landing a 757! Good nighttime road visibility.

Leather seats, moonroof, looks. A great 4wd system. Great stereo. Center stack is set up really nice. Cargo area is great for a trip to Costco!

Great interior, MP3, steering mounted audio contols, warranty and free roadside assistance (ask for when you are buying one, saves on insurance) and loaded saftey features and reclining rear seats.
