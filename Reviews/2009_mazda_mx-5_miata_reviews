The PRHT is so eazy and fast, and I love that it does not take up your trunk space. Manual shift is quick and responsive. Auto temp control, the red dash lights, overall look (gets alot of attention), love just about every little feature. 

The handling, the new "Credit Card" like key that you can leave in your pocket and never take out. The great reliability NO problems with this car and this is my 3rd Mazda and my 2nd Miata

Bluetooth, MP3, seats, handling, ride, brakes, sound, top, color, style, stereo, lets just say everything.

Sporty, great handling, light weight, just enough power to prevent me from getting tickets, great shifter in the 6MT.

looks, ease of soft top, way it handles on the road.

Silky smooth 6 speed transmission,sexy PRHT 12 seconds open close time,suspension package/Bilstein shocks with limited slip-DSC WITH TRACTION CONTROL, great gas mileage

The overall fun factor of just driving the car. This car makes you think you are on vacation every day!

Higher redline and overall drivetrain and interior tweaks. Super reliability based on my 99 and 07 Miatas, never a single problem. Got Homelink, Bluetooth phone, keyless, and TPM. Price undercuts base Z4/Boxster by $25K or the Z4 Turbo/Boxster S by 35K. Cash in my pocket. Low cost of ownership.
