Quite simply, a gorgeous car. No beating the cyber grey metallic.

SPEED



505 HP and of cours the looks

Configurable Heads Up Display

The looks had 2 red ones now black, my only regret. 

HUD, stereo, exhaust, 505hp 

The paddle shift on the wheel provides a real sporty touch to the car and the cyber grey color is a real winner

4LT package, performance package,keyless entry, and matching body accessories. 

HUD, XM radio, Bluetooth phone link, 505hp, styling, keyless start and entry, easy exit seats, short throw shifter, huge cargo space, dual exhausts, large speedo and tach, electric telescopic steering wheel.

The dual mode exhaust.

Mileage, ride, easy-fun to drive. Love the paddle shifting

If I could pick a favorite feature, It would be a toss up between the 4LT interior package and the NPP dual mode exhaust. 4LT for appearance and NPP for awesome throaty sound.

Lights - the HIDs are fantastic; the manual shifter is very slick. The Cyber Gray is fantastic in person. The engine/power is seamless. Targa top. Much improved interior - very classy. The Z51 package handles very well without a punishing ride
