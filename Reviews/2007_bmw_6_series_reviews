The car is an excellent piece of engineering (except for the rear suspension)

Substantial agility despite its size. Unparallelled fit and finish. Unbelievable technology throughout the vehicle.

Sound of the exhaust, head-up display, comfortable sport seats, park assist, smooth and responsive acceleration, legendary BMW braking.

The exterior styling is great. The convertible roof is quick and seamless.

Performance, styling and handling. iDrive is easy to learn. Creature comforts abound.

It is fun and comfortable to to drive.

But for the severe problems I have noted the vehicle is fun to drive.

HUD, night vision, comfort access.

Engine, fast-operating convertible top, handling, Sirius, navigation, sleek sexy exterior, free maintenance.

Great style and lines. The "giddy-up" and stereo sound system is top notch. Nice to have an iPod adapter built into the car.

The lines and style are wonderful. All the negative press regarding the iDrive is ridiculous. I have an S550 and the BMW is at least as intuitive.

Styling. This car is very good looking with the top up or down. Looks like a muscle car but way to refined to be categorized as such. Excellent power and torque for a car this size. Comfortable seating and storage capacity. The iDrive with voice activation is very intuitive and easy to use. 

Heads up display, comfort access and stereo system.

Powerful styling and comfort at speed.

I prefer to use the voice recognition to input destination for the navigation. Makes it easier and safe while driving. I like the iPod adapter, bluetooth, comfort access, active cruise control, head-up display, and the night vision is pretty cool to use in back roads/country roads.

Styling and looks, very classy car, inside and out.

The performance of the car is superb and the car handles beautifully even though it is not a light-weight. The fit and finish is tops.
