the pure ride comfort is second to none as stated previously 

Drive: very smooth and quiet. Transmission shifts are outstanding. XM radio.

Love the towing power, like the bucket seats with center console.

Heated Leather, Auto All Wheel Drive, that Wonderful 6 Speed Automatic and it's Manners, The Whole Truck Really...Lots of Details. VERY Quiet on the Hiway even at 85 MPH. Fuel Economy...I have got around 21 MPG running 70 a couple times. 

Wood grain interior/20 inch Rims, side step bars. Get up and go power. Onstar. AFM.

Great power, sweet ride on the highway; little noise. Gas mileage is pretty good for a truck. Bucket front seats are nice. The rear seat folds up super easy; I understand this was an issue on prior year models.

comfort and the look have really grown on me its a classy truck oh yeah silly but i like the way everyone with trucks looks over at it and nod there head even when there driving f150s and dodges lol

Great Chevy V8 powerplant makes me grin when I hit the gss peddle hard. But over all its the whole package and value.

Interior

Ride and comfort!

interior,onstar,better power than expected

20 Inch Rims Sleek Style On STAR XM Air Control Instrument panel Leather Seats Cargo Space

Nice smooth quite ride.

Comes standard with auto/air/CD and other extras. The seats are very good for base level.

6 sp. auto/manual transmission. XM and on star. Ride and engine.

The 170 degree rear doors. Smooth transition between 8 and 4 cylinders.

Bluetooth, nav system, backup camera, plenty of power, ride and the handling of the truck. Interior is beautiful light and dark cashmere leather.



Integrated trailer brake controller. What a great idea for those of us ho tow larger trailers fairly regularly.

I love the ability to put the truck in AWD instead of having to put up with the shortcomings of a 4WD option only. It saves the tires and removes another item of concern from the driver, especially in bad weather.
