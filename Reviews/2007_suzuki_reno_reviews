Great handling, air blows ice cold and I'm Arizona where its 125 in the summer, reliable, very responsive.

Radio with MP3 capability and front AUX input, 8 spkrs. Speed sensitive steering. Italian hatchback styling. Interior room. Dash layout. Standard features and 100k powertrain warranty. Not a BMW or Audi but as an entry level vechicle, better than expected.

Rear wiper and defogger, sound system, exterior design. 

Don't see any on the road, small size can fool anyone ounce you sit inside, very easy to park, daytime running lights are really nice feature, solid construction and value for price. 

Simple dash layout. Quick acceleration. Impressive sound system. Smooth automatic. Space for 4 full size adults.

The sound system that is standard is more than I expected.

My favorite feature is the foot pounds of torque.

CD, MP3 and the cruise, child latch system.

The variable intermittent wipers, power windows and power side mirrors, sound system, overall design, and tire low-pressure warning light. 

The small size and how it is not a gas guzzler.

The exterior design.

The comfort and ease of driving in mountain areas. I like a car that has adequate power and is good handling for curvy mountain roads. Being able to reach all of the controls without stretching is a great plus.

The interior styling, sound system, and how it is such an easy driving car.

The sound system is great.
