Interior and exterior looks. Extended cab is nice for storing - no need for toolbox in bed. Comfortable ride. Wouldn't mind taking it on long trips. Powerful V6. Just an overall great truck. Wouldn't change it.

Comfortable seats, V-8 has plenty of power and is smooth and quiet. Perfect size, roomy interior, neat storage bins under rear seat. 

Powerful V8, interior room, comfortable/quiet, towing capability.

Big Horn edition looks are amazing. Love the interior seating, back seats fold up to reveal storage slots, awesome feature. The front end is a much better improvement from Dakota's of past. Bluetooth standard is pretty cool.

Not too big, not too small. Great V8 power. 310 HP, 329 lbs of torque. Yet I'm getting 18 mpg on highway, which is not bad for a V8. Note that 2008 V8 has 2 spark plugs per cylinder, and gets as good as mileage as most V6s. Go for the power, baby! Heated seats are great. MyGig stereo with VR

Ride, power, satellite radio, exterior looks.

4x4, cargo light, foldable arm-rest + console, comfort, sleek design.

Interior, Fit and finish, towing capability, Sirius radio, power seats, easy to drive.

V8 is awesome, might be faster than the Hemi in the Ram due to the Ram being a 1000 LBS more. 

V-8,interior room, handling, fuel mileage (considering what it is), looks, I like it all!

Looks

I bought the Laramie with the tow package. I like the heated seats, and the remote start has been a blessing in this cold winter

The body style.

The rear storage baskets are collapsible and are a neat feature. The cargo rails w/moveable tie downs are a long-overdue improvement. YES fabrics are nice feature and are easy to clean up, especially good for fleet use.
