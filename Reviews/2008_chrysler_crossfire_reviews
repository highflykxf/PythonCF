Go-kart feel. Seating position once settled. Style. Buy this car if you're 19 inside and a late boomer on the outside. Creature comforts are fine, but more 90's than naughts.

The styling, convertible top, 2-tone interior, flip-up spoiler and the Mercedes engine, transmission, suspension, etc. underneath the Chrysler-designed body.

My favorites, Looks, How it drives, The convertible top. Unlimited powertrain warranty, Mileage. It gets around 25 mpg. Great pickup.

The drive. It makes me feel sturdy, stable, and intensely powerful. It's kind of an aphrodisiac. The exterior design. It's a statement of boldness. 

Power top, incredible looks, and a nametag that is American....yeah I know the guts are German...

Looks, distinctive styling, solid construction. Mostly Mercedes components. Rare in this area. Expect low depreciation after first 4 years. (My poor condition 1981 Delorean is worth more than I paid for it; not nearly as good a car as the crossfire.) Look at prices of 2003 Thunderbirds.

Side fins, spoiler, dash, concept car look, still get compliments all the time! Price! 22k with 1200 miles I stole it!

Low profile and spoiler look great. Power top operates flawlessly. Quick steering. Tires grip the road well. Factory warranty

Two tone interior and unique body styling.

Looks, ride, and gas mileage

Looks and ride.
