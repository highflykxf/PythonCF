Allison tranny, nice cab design,quiet engine for a diesel!

Love the OnStar e-mail updates & MP3 connect. Only thing I've had to change is the oil & filter; have K&N air filter. Tranny fluid is still full & pink. Plenty of torque; have to be careful when road is wet.

Comfort. And it's quiet. Fuel economy. Towing. Power. 

Firm ride, drives and pulls great with the loads I've used so far.

Allison transmission is awesome and limitless power from the diesel. Very quiet on the road.

The brakes are real treat after my Jeep Wrangler, which had underpowered brakes and front rotors that warped consistently. The truck gets a lot of looks.

6.6 Duramax and Allison is great combo very strong. Fuel mileage excellent, 15.8 in town 19.6 on highway.

Power of the Duramax and the Allison transmission - perfect for towing.

6.6 Duramax engine,6 speed Allision trans. Interior comfort, and fuel mileage.



6 speed transmission and the electric sliding rear window.

New dash, everything

The whole truck!

The back seats fold down for an incredible amount of room for either my 2 German Shepherds, groceries, horse feed or whatever. The Duramax is great. Lots of power and quick acceleration making it a great towing truck. 

Duramax engine and Allison transmission. I also enjoy the seats and arm rests. The rear seating is tight, but manageable in the Ext Cab. Flipping the back seats can be done one handed. Also, I really enjoy the simple but refined setup of all the controls on the dash.
