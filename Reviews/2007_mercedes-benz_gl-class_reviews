Interior design and comfort. Power. Excellent ride and very quiet. Third row seat comfort. Flat folding power third row seats. Hauling capacity.

The car looks great, fuel economy, commendable. Very comfortable to drive, but rear seats lack flexibility&remain in an almost upright position. I think on a car this size, those seats should go all the way back, especially when rear seats are down flat, more so when you are going far with the kids.

Design. It's the best looking SUV on the road. Build quality seems exceptional.

Luxurious quiet ride and feel, and so much power! Will out accelerate a Cadillac Escalade. Lots of room and great looks. The education it gave me to go back to BMW.

Drives extremely well, steering is excellent, engine has adequate power and is very responsive.

Seats, including the third row seats, are very comfortable. Everything you touch is top quality. All rear seats fold flat. Auto tailgate and power fold-down rear seats. Air suspension.

3rd row flat fold and 3rd row leg room, overall quality, great acceleration, smooth ride, parking sensors are great, A/C gets cold instantly even on hottest days, overall interior comfort.

Great ride. Great handling. Goes a long, long way between fill-ups!

Smooth powerful engine. Smooth comfortable ride. Goes anywhere in snow and does it with style. V-8 gets 16mpg around town, and 19 mpg on the highway. Rear entertainment and power everything. Just better looking than any other large SUV out there!

The GL is a great city car with a short turning radius and excellent visibility out the big, low rear side windows for lane changes, parking and such. More goodies: All side windows open. Two sun roofs. Fit and finish, style, quality and comfort of the standard MB Tex 7 seat interior is excellent. 

Darn fun to drive! Seat warmers rock! Plenty of space for a family of 5. Controls on the driving wheel for gears, phone and sound system very convenient. Turns heads.

My favorite feature is the way it drives.

An absolutely wonderful driving machine. The CDI gets wonder mileage and has great torque for pulling. 7 speed transmission is a dream to drive. Seat heaters work to perfection. Power fold down seats are very nice. Third seat room is the terrific. Engine is quiet and smooth.

1) Very responsive handling for it's size! 2) Memory seats on both front seats 3) Roomy interior 4) Cruise control is super easy

Everything is as it should be



Acceleration. Quiet. Navigation. Third row leg room. Safety front & rear parking sensors. IPOD jack. Power tailgate. Harman Kardon sound system. Power third row seat

400lb-ft torque! rear 3/4 windows open, 7 speed auto surprisingly doesn't hunt, leather stitching & leather covered dash; solidity and drive smoothness give impression of an S-class not an SUV, backup camera, 3rd row seats, hitch, zero wait time to start, push button close rear door

The IPOD integration kit is a must. Sunroof package is super. Very comfortable. Great acceleration with smooth ride

The transmission is very underrated and the ergonomics are excellent. My kids love the COMAND sysstem.



Third row seats (pop up/down) pick up and performance. comfort. Convenience.

Air suspension. Engine, there is no detectable acceleration lag. Quietness. Ride. Suggest premium, lighting, and appearance packages. 19 inch wheels - Dad's favorite. Comfort access - wife's favorite dual headrest DVD - kid's favorite. Adults can ride in the powered third row.

Seats, including the third row seats, are very comfortable for my 6'0. Everything you touch is top quality. All rear seats fold flat. Auto tailgate and power fold-down rear seats. Technology on this vehicle is neverending so be prepared to learn. Incredible safety features. Rear view cam

V8 engine, Bluetooth, auto leveling, and handling.

Super quiet, great mileage diesel engine. Quiet smooth ride. Beautiful interior, head turning appearance. 19" tires and wheels.

I love size and the looks. Navigation is a little complicated but fine once you get the hang of it. The Comm center gives you more information than you'll probably ever want. It has a great ride with a good road feel. You simply can't believe it's a diesel - no delay starting and it's quiet!

Off-Road package with damping system. Rearview camera. P1 package, multi-contour seats, iPod, engine power, curise control, phone.

Must have the hands-free phone, auto dimming mirrors. Recommend highly the rear view camera, heated steering wheel. Love the automatic rear hatch closer and the automated raising and lowering of the third row seats. Automated third row windows a nice touch.

The vehicle is large on the inside but drives/handles like a smaller vehicle. The engine has abuntant power and the transmission is amazingly smooth. We love the gorgeous and comfortable interior. Power operated 3rd row seats can actually be used by adults! My wife loves the back-up camera.

The smooth ride, the fit and finish, the roominess, excellent SUV.

Traction control works great in snow. Heated steering wheel is very nice. Satelite radio is great, where have I been?

Bluetooth and air suspension

I love the space and how it has so much power compare to other SUV's The design is one of the best.

Smooth, quiet ride. I went and put the 22-inch brabus wheels on it and its still whisper quiet and handles better now. Power folding third row is slick, along with air-suspension.

Handling is super smooth and rock solid. The air suspension is great; after getting a foot of snow around the car (thanks mr. snowplow), I just turned on the air lift and drove right out, no problem. This SUV is hands down the best today.

Incredibly quiet cabin, even on the highway. Amazingly smooth ride, like a Mercedes S class. Absolutely gorgeous interior. Gorgeous leather and real birds-eye maple wood trim is stunning. Great sound system, and Mercedes Benz unmistakable and incomparable quality

Handling, ride, options. Nav system, rear camera, sound system, folding mirrors. Auto lowering and raising of all windows. Leveling system that lowers on the highway.

My personal favorite are the big cup holders. You get a lot of leg room. The 3rd row power folds in seconds.
