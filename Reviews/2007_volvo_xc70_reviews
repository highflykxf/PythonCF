Ride, AWD, Interior, sound system is amazing. MPG better than I expected (esp. compared to an SUV) . I have been getting 20-21 mpg commuting to work- 7 miles of interstate and 3 miles of city driving. My avg while on the interstate is mid 26+, even better when I keep it a little under 70:)

I love the handling of the XC70. Nice cornering and ease on the highway.

My Volvo is equipped with Sirius satellite radio, xeon headlamps that turn with the car in curves. This is a great safety feature in my opinion.

Everything is great!

Plenty of room, especially in the trunk. Very suitable for long trips by two people. Very stable in bad driving conditions. You can rely on it. 

Front leather seats, headlamp washers, heated mirrors, driver power seat with memory.

The navigation system and all the new safety features.



Handles well in snow. Safety features. 

Exterior design. Interior lights.

The navigation system,which helped us driving into Stockholm.
