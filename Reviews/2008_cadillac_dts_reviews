the sound system / touch screen radio, etc., heated steering wheel & seats.

The parking sensors help me park this relatively long vehicle in tight New York parking spots with ease.

The Northstar engine.

Love the color, Black Cherry and the tan leather interior seats. It's handy to have the controls on the steering wheel. 

I like the size. No, it's not as large as the older models, so it is easier to drive/park, but it is still large enough to have lots of room. Rear seat passengers feel like they are in a limo! Top of the line glass adds to the quiet ride. The V8 has torque that V6s can only dream of! 

Beauty (Styling with White Diamond paint), comfort and safety. Easy to drive and handle. Large rearview mirrors with front and rear park assist. Easy to live with roof line (don't hit head getting in and out) and trunk access.

Large, well appointed interior. Comfortable seats. Excellent rear seat leg room. Huge trunk. Easy to use stereo. 

Interior room and comfort.

 Comfortable ride; spacious trunk and large back seat. It takes regular gas, goes 15,000 miles or so between oil changes and easy to use controls. The exterior design is aesthetically pleasing and the quality of the product has been excellent. 10,000 miles in six months and no problems at all.
