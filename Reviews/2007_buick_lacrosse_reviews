Nothing

seats

Quiet/smooth ride! Nice styling and interior features. Love the XM Sirrus radio and OnStar. I hope GM, OnStar and XM Sirrius stay in business.

Way it rides

Sunroof, folding back seats into trunk, smooth ride

That it is a Buick .

Dual climate control, traction control, automatic running lights. 

Looks

Nothing I would call favorite.

Great sound system and comfortable seat.

OnStar, heated seats, sat.radio, size of car, good size trunk (I can get 4 golf bags in it.)

I love the XM radio, the 6 cd changer, OnStar, leather seats, remote starting of the car, electronic monitoring devices. There is not enough space to include all of my favorite features.

Folding armrest is cool. Car has good pickup for my highway driving.

Quiet ride

Nimble when it counts. Quiet in the city or on the highway. Leather, nicely appointed interior. Great body style.

Can't think of anything outstanding.

Computerized average gas mileage and speed.

Too many to choose. From the canyonous trunk to the customisable features we love everthing about it.

Great looking from all angles, handles well, quick acceleration, smooth ride and nice interior. Also On Star, XM Radio, Driver Information Center and a great 5 year 100,000 mile warranty.



Smooth ride, roomy, dual climate controls and remote start

Quietness, sound system.

Chrome accents on outside. Engine performance. Light leather interior. Outstanding handling and ride.

Ride and handling. The sound system is very good. Exterior styling is understated elegance. Interior fit and finish are great.



3.8 engine, dual zone climate control, concert sound system, build quality.

Dahsboard. XM radio. Quiet ride. Road handling.



Style, confort, roadability, and quiet. Almost no road noise whatsoever!

Instrumentation very visible and complete
