Roomy interior. Decent power, 3.7 V6 is a proven engine from Dodge. Interior features are easy to use. Comfortable seats. Attractive styling.

Its exterior design in particular is beautiful and striking, it does not look like any other truck out there and I like that. She's long and very nimble in traffic.

It is a very handsome truck. It turns heads. I feel very safe in my Raider. I love the size and well, everything about it. I hope to drive him for many years.
