The Turbo Diesel. The exterior design. The roominess of the rear cargo space. The backup camera.

Comfort, fit and finish, power from a V6, back up camera, Sirius radio.

The iPod interface. Power folding mirrors as well as power trunk closer.

I didn't want the rear seat entertainment package at first, but it works very well. The bluetooth feature works well. But why is there no voice activated controls with this vehicle? I did not understand the voice activation buttons on the steering wheel. It turns out that they are useless. 





Power liftgate, iPod interface, steering and handling, rear camera, interior lighting, roadside assistance and information buttons. 

Lots of power. Lots of room inside. 3 power outlets, rain sensing wipers, folding mirrors, power tailgate, great looks, ipod connection and I haven't even tried the steering wheel gearshift controls

Diesel turbo, 7 speed transmission, size and comfort, great looking vehicle.

Dual DVD's, easy to use navagation, satellite, and overall handling.
