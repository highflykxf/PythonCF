engine 

Flys under the radar. Who expects a station wagon with 507 HP. Sometimes kids in the know give me the high sign because they know what it is - hilarious. Also tons of room. 



4 Matic (insurance for bad weather), Sports package, iPod, fantastic Harmon Kardon sound system, seat heaters, and manumatic.

Would really say a lot of things I like about the car..interior comfort and quality, ride, handling, fit and finish and really most everything about the car. 

Stereo systems very good. Sound quality excellent. The best feature is the seat comfort and location of controls. 

Great gas mileage (22 city / 30 highway) with great performance. Hit a pothole, blew out a tire and rim. Happy to find a pair of gloves and large plastic bag to place the tire when putting into trunk. Those Germans, they think of everthing.

The diesel engine, love the soft sound. Extraodinary power. Smooth comfortable ride. Great handling.

Sports package, which makes the car a lot more fun to drive. Navigation, fantastic sound system. I also love how the 6 disk changer flips out behind the panel, looks really cool. 

Adjustable & heated seats. Lots of storage in the trunk and convenient hidden compartment under each seat. Gas tank locks and unlocks automatically. Best is if you hold down the lock/unlock button, it rolls the windows up or down in sync.

Power, elegant looks, 7 speed transmission, convential hydraulic brakes,seat comfort, safety features, quiet ride, keyless go, sound system, ventilated seats, 4 zone climate control, iPod, Voice Control, folding rear seats, DVD navigation, telescoping steering wheel, satellite radio, and bluetooth.

Classy MB looks, acceleration, comfort, keyless go, voice control, Pre Safe, seven speed transmission, Harman Kardon sound system, iPod, satellite radio, blue tooth phone, Xenon headlights with corner tracking fog lamps, all leather interior, 4 zone AC, ventilated and heated seats, auto wipers.

Overall driving impression; turning radius is great (Acura was horrible), Safety; a pleasure to drive; 7 speed tranny; at first the clock in the instrument panel bugged me, but now I use it all of the time and like it; insurance through AAA actually wasn't that bad.

Great power. E550 feels as fast as my former M5. Looks good. Smooth transmission. The mid-size feels very responsive, I made final decision because of availability of 4matic on a car with this performance level.

I-Pod, stereo system superior to BMW Logic 7, walnut wood (special order option on Sport Package) is so rich, electronics take much practice to master, but seem fine. Power sunshade is a plus here in Florida and comfort is superior to BMW.

The engine, transmission, my car color choice (Indium Grey), and the sound of the exhaust.

Ride quality, powertrain, leather seating, 420 watt stereo, communication center, DVD navigation, just so near to perfection for an automobile

Auto A/C, sat radio, heated seats, "The Star" on the hood 

Comfort, performance and iPod integration

Ipod controls on the wheel. Analog clock, information display interface on the steering wheel, Teleaid.

Build quality and optional gimmicks. Safety features. Quietness and sound system. Finally a comfortable driving position for my 6'4", 250 lb frame! Engine smoothness and responsiveness. Ride smoothness. 

Smooth ride, navigation system (actually works), glass roof, mood lighting, 4matic, huge trunk. I like how it's the last Mercedes with a standing hood ornament, and roomy interior. Timeless. Truly a great companion on an arduous commute. 

Build quality, refinement, luxury, standard 4MATIC AWD for excellent handling and grip in dry and wet weather

4matic is flawless in any weather condition. COMAND navi system works great when you get the hang of it. The suspension is tuned sharply enough for good handling, yet soft enough for a smooth cruise. Feels very solid and tank like also.

Agressvie looks, fast, responsive, very stable at high speed, sure foot feeling, excellent brakes.

Ipod integration, voice control, and keyless go, voice control, Ipod integration. These are the best but the rest are grat and i have had no problem with this one or with my previous E-class.

Design, silver color, black interior, ride, ample power.

Gas mileage to horsepower is great. Dual power heated front seats. Short turning radius, 6CD/MP3 player/Sirius/GPS System, Ipod hookup, Bluetooth. Slow speed engine rpm and quietest I have ever driven

First, I have averaged 32.5 mpg over 28,000 miles. I was getting 19mpg in the E500 4-Matic that I traded. I like the MB tex standard because I often have my large Autralian Shepard with me. Just wipe clean. Normally the passengers are limited to my wife and me and the dog, plenty of room.

Sport package a must. The interior is very nice and comfortable love the feel of the wood wheel. At 80 -90 mph car feels like it's going 55

Engine is smooth and powerful. Panoramic roof. Sirius and iPOD integration. Heated and ventilated seats, window shades.

Map function is so improved over previous versions. It's actually usable. Totally helpful in unfamiliar locales with variable map scales. Works well passively, meaning I do not need to be pushing buttons repeatedly.

Great ride quality. Steering/braking excellent. Fit & finish both inside & out 2nd to none. Good power available through all speeds. Better cargo-area than most competitor's wagons .Rational layout & features, no quirky "why did they do that?" aspects.

The ride is fantastic. 

Style, paint, interior and fit and finish. Ride and handling.

Torque is great for getting out of the way. The bluetooth phone makes the best speaker phone on the planet through the Harmon Kardon.

Quiet. Very low wind and road noise. Gas mileage, 25 mpg in mixed driving overall, very consistent over first 3500 miles. Great highway commuter and comfortable people mover. Great fit and finish. Best headlight coverage ever!

GPS, brakes, sport wheels and styling, pick up, smooth ride.

Our iPhone plugs right in and we can play our music through the ipod cable. The ride, comfort
