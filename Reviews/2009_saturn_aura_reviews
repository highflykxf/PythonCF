compliments on nice appearance "pretty"



Remote start, Onstar, Bluetooth, gas mileage.

The car is pretty. 

The exterior color is beautiful and the leather seats are gorgeous. I also really enjoy the CD/Stereo.

look

Mileage great, exterior design and moroccan leather seat design.

Adjustable pedals...rear seat audio and headsets..sun roof windbreaker.. XM radio..OnStar.

Looks stylish

Fantastic gas mileage, gets as good as US EPA rating for Smart car with Aura's 6 speed auto and www.slipstreamfs.com low drag coating. And this in everyday Real World driving... not on a dynamometer like the EPA rating! So which one is really the Smart car? I'd say this Aura is the real smart car.

honest 30+ mpg highway. 25 MPG around town. great styling, quiet engine, XM radio. 6 speed automatic. Drives nicer than a 4 cylinder camry or accord

Gas Mileage, XR equipment pkg ( great value). Good handling for front wheel drive car. Morocco Brown leather with (Black) Carbon Flash exterior looks smart. Bluetooh works very well and easy to connect to phone. MP3 connection also convenient. Head sets for rear passengers with own radio controls.

Heated outside mirrors add to safety in winter conditions. Two level heated front seats are also a winter plus. Standard paddle shifter while not a positive feature for maximizing fuel economy is fun to play with. 

Seating, ease of control, very good handling and ride, top notch interior and materials compared to Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford, or Hyundai

Driver information center with average and instant MPG, tire pressures, and avg speed. Convenient layout of controls. Bluetooth connection for my cell phone. OnStar assistance. And good looks/styling

The manu-matic was enjoyable, but doesn't overcome deficiencies discovered when driving this car.
