It sets up like a true SUV and it drives truly like a Cadillac.

Quiet, hugs the road, comfortable for hours on end

Handling, nav, electronic tailgate, panoramic sunroof



V8, sport package, Bose sound system, contol in bad weather, exhaust note

Bose sound system. Automatic (1 and 2 position)adjustable seats. Acceleration. Terrific ride and comfort. Interior is 5 star.

I love the sunroof and the bose system the look of the dash, the clock, just about every feature.

Luxury Package

The vehicle is very comfortable, handles well, it has AWD so big difference from the STS which he drove for 3 years and I sometimes drove but did not like. (he is now in the DTS)



The V8.

Power lift gate, all wheel drive, nav system, power of V6

comfort, sound, ride, luxurious interior

Sound system, sport pack, ride and a real nice suspension. The interior feels like a millionaire's living room.

XM radio and the ride

The whole package looks good, drives good and is just plain creature comfortable. Bought the Sports Package with AWD and 20" wheels. The size is perfect. This vehicle is a little narrower, shorter and lighter than some other large SUV's which is very desirable when driving in congestion.

Comfortable seats with heat and awesome sound system..

The V8. Magnet ride. XM radio. Look of the vehicle. Bose. DVD navigation. Electric lift tailgate. The best of everything!

the luxury toys ...

I love the XM radio, Bose sound, DVD navigation system, the huge sunroof, ultraview roof, remote tail lift.

Handling, sunroof, little amenities like the heated steering column, multi- positional seat, wonderfully crisp Bose sound system.

Sunroof, power pedals (my daughter, who has short legs, can now drive at a safe distance from the steering wheel), entertainment options (XM radio + 6-disc cd changer + Ipod connection), luxury all around
