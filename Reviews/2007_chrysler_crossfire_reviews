6spd , feel and performance

Top down. Outstanding looks. Comfort. Performance and handling. Solid with superior fit and finish. Great sound when playing cds. 

The most important feature for me is it's accelleration and speed. I don't push it anymore but love knowing that I could if I wanted to.

Fun to drive. Comfortable seats.

I like the V6 power, handling it great and that power convertible top is a blast to operate.

Convertible top is obviously the best feature as it is all done from within the drivers seat. Style is fantastic and always a head turner. 

Quality of leather seats and feel of controls (aside from shifter.. sometimes) handling, sound of engine with magnaflow exhaust, exterior and interior looks.

interior and auto top / spoiler

Spoiler adds a bit of style when driving with it up

So many that no room to tell all. Just found out the other day when I looked at the radio that it gave the name of the song playing and the singers name . So many features that I am still exploring.

Big tires for smooth ride.

Style- exterior and interior. Mine is Gold Oyster Pearl Metallic outside and Dark Slate Gray/Spruce inside. This is a beautiful car!

Won't see many on road...going out of production....serious fun to look at & drive. 151 mph top speed, 0.91G lat accel. Nice growl when pushed. Great on ice & snow...with DSC, traction control & anti-locks. Automatic wing a hoot!

Top down, stereo playing, country roads
