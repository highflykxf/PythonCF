When it runs.

Diesel love the smell...

Exhaust brake, 6 speed, mega cab, quieter motor.

Pulling power, 6 spd trans, sound of engine, pick up speed

Power! Navigation for finding anything from good restaurants in Cape Cod, to Las Vegas, to finding a hotel, fuel station, or even a post office. Very comfortable for long trips. Engine brakes were priceless in the Rockies, and other areas of the country. Roomy. Easy to zip around any city.

Cummins engine and the six speed automatic transmission.

i like the way it drives and rides, the interior and the way it looks.

My 2007 Six speed manual is better then my 2004 automatic. The electric 4x4 shift works very well! It gives more room for storage. 5046 pounds of truck bed payload is great! I can load up my Lance 1141 camper. The ground clearance is awesome, even loaded! The loaded RAM can still crawl in the mud.

Interior comfort, built in GPS great for cross country driving.

Quiet, Cummins, 6-speed auto. Simple comfortable interior. Fit and finish. 

Power, tons of power. Six speed bullet proof. Seats are firm and looks are great. Oh and the mileage, 23 before broke in.

Navigation, engine, exhaust, brakes, 6 speed auto with autostick and tow haul, bucket seats, 6.7 big daddy cummins diesel

Huge backseat, power
