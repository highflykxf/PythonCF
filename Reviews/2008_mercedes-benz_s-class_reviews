The Nappa seats (the best I have ever experienced, by far) COMMAND, Distronic Plus, rear reclining seats, ABC, smooth V12 engine,and the impressive, not polarizing looks.

Interior, voice commands, keyless go, iPod integration, Bluetooth, Parktronics and most of all the V8 engine.

Styling, handling, and performance, plus incredible comfort

The bottom of the front seat that extends out. I have long legs, what a simple but wonderful feature.

Great performance for its size. There are no compromise and this is by far the heaviest accelerating machine I have seen. Unless Ferrari can build a sedan that outperform F430, this is the best performance sedan. I had E55 AMG and older M5. They were good but, lacked comfort.

Ride, power, back-up camera, looks of AMG ground effects, GPS

Nappa leather is ultra luxurious (but worried about wear and tear). Keyless go rocks. 



Way the car soaks up bumps and ruts without the soft, floaty ride epitomized by Lexus LS. COMMAND and nav system. Great acceleration, steering, breaks and curve hugging. Heated steering wheel option.

Interior materials, ease of controls, voice command, seats, trunk closer, auto closing doors, engine power, sound system. The overall quality.

Probably the best seats in the world (in or out of a car). The 20" wheels. Love the voice recognition - really works. Paddle shifter. The sound (outside). The sound (inside). The COMAND system, almost intuitive. Rear-looking TV. Brakes, handling, and did I mention acceleration?

Wonderfully comfortable seats, spacious trunk, electronics that are easy for me to use, effortless power, beautiful cabin design, all the luxury I could ever want in a single car

Ride dynamic multi-contour seats are awesome. They bolster you on turns.ABC keeps the car level on turns. The audio system sounds great, and offers AM/FM/WB radio, CD, MP3 memory slot, Sirius satellite radio, and iPod itegration kit. You have it all! Power rear door window shades are neat.

Drive active seats keep you and your passenger planted in your seats during spirited driving while being massaged. Command center opperates all convienence features and is easy to use. integrated bluetooth works like a charm and displays my cell phone address book on the display panel.
