IPOD jack, stereo, seat comfort, smooth power from drivetrain

Seating and safety is a given. Pleasantly surprised by the pickup - 6 cylinder is much more fun than the mercedes.

Personal Car Communicator/keyless start, power lift gate, blind spot information system, Volvo towing package (expensive but worth it)

The seats, blind spot information system (an option), smooth and quiet driving, the incredibly well thought- out trunk compartment 

Handing, comfort and styling. Very pleased with the gas mileage.

Roominess, interior and exterior looks and ease of parking and steering given the size. Very comfortable and easy to drive.

Seats are outstanding. Lift gate gives great access to rear.

The vehicle is comfortable - even for a 6'4", all legs person. The interior is well appointed without being over the top and I do like the exterior styling. Others seem to find it pleasing as well.

Interior design. Exterior styling. Ipod interface cable (expensive but useful for "active listeners") Personal Car Communicator My rating may seem low due to driving performance, but I want to emphasize that the car is great for most driving and I expect it to be fantastic for longer trips.

The radio sounds awesome!, comfortable seats, nice options, I have Sirius, leather, PCC, moonroof.

Comfort and safety.
