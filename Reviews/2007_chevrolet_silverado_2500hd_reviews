A fan of cloth interior. Gauges easy to see/read. Big interior (crew cab) 

Comfort, power, good looks, great gas mileage.

comfort, power, ease of towing

Definitely the Allison 6sp Transmission

Allison tranny and the duramax. Effortless power with great mileage, 18 mpg on average, and when towing 13 to 14 mpg

Getting rid of it

New grille design and the overall look of the truck. I love the Desert Brown metallic with the cashmere interior. A little different than the standard white, black or red trucks out there. 

Everything except gas mileage.

The diesel engine.

Powerful motor, aggressive looks

Redesigned interior, including black leather. Fit and finish is great, and nice upgrade on materials. Intergrated brake control. Duramax diesel, pulls our toyhauler & bikes (10,000+ lbs) w/ little effort & very quite. Easy flip up back seats w/ flat floor, leaves big interior space. Camping mirrors.

Black interior, new for Silverado, hides the interior wear and tear of being a truck pretty well. Trailering mirrors. Quite cabin, even with diesel much quieter than 07 gas truck. Radio memory channels that you can mix AM, FM & XM. Much less plastic on exterior, so easier to wax. Split back seat.

Power, interior, gotta get the Nav system, quiet, adjustable pedals. Seat fold up in back giving space from floor to ceiling

Power pulling a trailer. Bose sound system. Comfortable interior.

Information center, integrated trailer braking, steering wheel controls, handling, smooth ride, appearance, very quiet motor.

The new higher box. The grille, The 6 speed trans, and the Z71 off road package in a 2 wheel drive.

The performance of the Duramax. Quick, responsive, and no push the pedal and wait. It's there always
