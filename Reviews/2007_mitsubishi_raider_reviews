Good power with the V8, comfortable, smooth ride, handles real nice for a truck, E-85 fuel option.

V-8, styling, comfort, and ride. Glad I am one of the lucky few who the V-8.

Sirius radio, solid ride, low gear ratio, fit and finish.

The features I found to really catch my eyes is the sleek frame design, as well as the extra space it provides.

Room inside the cab and the handling

I love the cab room

Style, power, visibility, ergonomics, ride quality.

Good looks, and great ride quality!

Sharpest exterior styling out there in midsize truck class. Class IV hitch, 4.7 V8. 6500LB towing capacity! Limited slip differential, tranny cooler, oversized radiator, Power interior controls, Nice seats, brushed aluminum trim augments interior retro space age design. Very well designed.

Styling by far is better then the new one or my '97 Dakokta. Interior very comfortable and I love the standard outside temp gauge. Sirius radio w/ 6 months for free is great. Not too many on the road, so it's nice to stand out and you can get these for a great price.

I love that it's 4dr with lots of space, has a bedliner and satellite radio.

The handling like a car, power, is equipped with Sirius radio! 

Just the style alone...rugged yet sophisticated
