Exterior appearance, satellite radio, steering wheel radio controls, roomy interior, and gas mileage

Aggressive exterior stying, interior controls layed out thoughtfully, seats are comfy, good gas mileage, very quiet interior.

Same feel on the road as my previous '03 Intrepid. More powerful 4- cyl. than my "new style" 2000 Neon. Great sound system! 

Sat Radio

Sleek appearance; solid construction; great performance

Interior space Trunk space Exterior styling Comfort Telescoping steering (not just tilt) Fuel economy

XM Radio, I like the loud turn signal (just me), stylish exterior, I like the tutone exterior(others complained) because it keeps the car cooler.

Roomy trunk and backseat. Stylish smooth ride.

Bold body style, great gas mileage (36 mpg for a v6 2.7!).

I like the look, the safety, and the gas mileage it gets. And, the life time power train warranty. Also, plenty of room in this car.

Performance/Comfort/Electronics/Room; not a mini van or station wagon but can still haul yor gear with the fold down rear seats, and it looks sharp!

I drive cars until the tires fall off. When I found out about the drive train life time (limited) warranty, I was sold... 

My gig radio and performance.

Handsome car design, reliable, rides very nice, was great in the snow this year, price is great. Lots of trunk space.
