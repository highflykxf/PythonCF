Duramax/Allison powertrain are the best on the civilian market - put the Allsion in "tow mode" and install a Prodigy brake controller and you'll never know the trailer's back there!

Duramax and Allison tranny, easy and fun to drive, engine brake in tow haul mode (great)

Diesel engine, Allison trans, heated leather seats, large extendable heated mirrors, OnStar, XM radio on the Bose system

Great Interior design and comfort! 

Vortec 8100 , Allison Automatic and 4.10 gears make for a real puller.

Diesel - fuel efficiency and cost can't be beat. Leather and Bose surround aren't bad either.

Love the sound of a big bore engine! Terrific ride! Pulls hard like a truck should with a 4:10 rear end. Simple to clean inside and out. The "Sleeper" clean looks of the old day street rods.

The gas pedal when the rpms get over 2k...man that turbo kicks in big time! Also like that the Chevy has the OnStar. I feel safer, especially when wife and newborn baby are with me. Can't beat it!

Duramax engine and the Allison transmission make this a super truck.

My favorite features are the Duramax and Allison. Together they are the best combination on the market

 I have the diesel and it accellerates much better than my Dodge 2500 with a Cummins. Less chatter, but a clear turbo-diesel sound. Brakes are outstanding. Pricing is steep compared to other trucks, but hey, it is a Chevy.
