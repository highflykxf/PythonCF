Automatic hard top

The convertible top is great to use. The styling of the car either top-up or top-down is terrific. 

Throttle response, throaty exhaust, comfortable seats, hardtop convertable, fit and finish. A Mercedes that is bringing back the name to be sure. Looks!

I especially like the air scarf from a practical standpoint; but it just looks sweet all wrapped up in a beautiful paint job. People driving Audis and Corvettes love to watch the retractable hardtop dissapear with envy. 

7 spd automatic, heated neck 'scarf,' Sirrius radio, TeleAid, roadside asst for as long as own vehicle, self- dimming outide mirror.

The retractable hard top is by far my favorite feature. I always wanted a convertible but I just couldn't see a soft top for several reasons - too easy to break into and not a good enough weather seal from the hot Texas sun in the summer time. The hard top has no such disadvantages.

Air scarf. Hard top convertible. One of the best looking front ends ever.

Heated air scarf. Ease of putting top up/down. Gas mileage(bonus). Wind skirt

It's a convertible



Red seats, hardtop, styling, sound of exhaust, placement of all controls. 

Looks outside and inside are best in class. Air scraf really does work great and extends the top-down season.



Fun car when it works.

Airscarf, woodtrim, nav, HK stereo, smooth ride but great performance and handling. Oh and awesome looking!



Airscarf, ipod hookup, and DVD navigation

Hardtop convertible. Fast and stable on freeways. Going at 65 or 95 feels the same, you just past other cars at much faster rate.

Placement of instruments and controls. Ability to set seat and controls for 3 different drivers.

Looks are it. If you want a poser vehicle, spend away. If you want performance I suggest you take another look, elsewhere.

The convertible hardtop, of course
