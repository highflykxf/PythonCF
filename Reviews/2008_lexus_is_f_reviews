Drivetrain is superb. Sound system good. Fuel economy awesome for what it is. I never see any on the road and, accordingly, this car gets tons of attention. Low profile enough, but mean looking enough to stand out.

Engine and the sound when the 2nd intake opens up, standard features and almost everything in the optional navigation system, and the almost too aggressive exterior styling. 

416 horses. Super fast transmission (manual mode). Ultra powerful brakes. Build quality. Quiet cabin (at least on smooth pavement).

Insane power, thru a wide range of the engine. Love the 8 speed tranny and the fit and finish of the whole car.

Sound, stereo, it's go-go-go.



Mark Levinson stereo, Sport mode, 27 mpg on interstate, torque

When I start it up, it roars to life! The Direct Shift automatic is a blast to drive.

Mid range intake kicks in like turbo.

Exterior styling, 19" OEM wheels, Brembo brakes

416 HP, gurgling sound on acceleration. Mark Levinson/ navi/ backup camera. Super nice 2 tone white/black interior, and exclusive to ISF ultrasonic Blue exterior. 

The interior, automatic transmission with paddles if you want to shift yourself, the navigation package with bluetooth and Mark Levinson stereo/rear back-up camera is a great option.The 416 hp 371 lb-ft of torque,5.0 liter 32 valve V8 engine 8 speed sport transmission.

Everything.

8 speed error reducing lightning fast, paddle shifting, launches. Aggressive exterior styling. Very audibly noticable robust 5.0 liter engine that screams once above 3600 RPM.

Suspension, dual air intake, rapid fire paddle shifters when pushing the envelope.

Backup camera. Parking assist. Big brakes. Mark Lev/DVD nav system. 416 hp. 170 mph top speed (although my car has hit 190 mph on the dynometer). 

Closest thing to a mototrcycle without bugs in your teeth. Very stealth most people can tell it's anything special. Engine sound over 4000 RPM is fantastic. Slides easily, neutrally and safely.

The 5.0 L engine and the 400 HP
