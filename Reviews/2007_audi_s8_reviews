The ipod interface is wonderful!

The motor. Period. The calm interior is also worthy of mention (unless you dip a wee bit too much into the throttle and bathe yourself in the thick Italian growl burbling from the V-10 Lambo motor). Haven't grown tired of the engine (not exhaust!) note after 12k miles. 

It's a very good looking car.

Pickup, styling.

I find the MMI easy to use, I love the the fact that it has 450 horses and is still 4 wheel drive, and I love the car in general.

Audi's MMI system is head and shoulders above any other. The B & O stereo is phenominal for a car system. MMI, keyless, soft door close, cornering lights.

Motor. Motor. Motor. Upon acceleration you hear the motor, not some contrived exhaust note. It is not loud; it just strikes the right note. Kind of like the BMW-powered Range Rovers. Refined muscle.

Engine, handling, quattro, AMI interface for iPod, interior second to none with alcantara headliner, brakes, MMI, trunk, wheels.

V10 engine and Bang and Olufsen stereo.

Best features include handling and performance, comfort, grace and convenience of interior. I personally like the look of the car a great deal, but that's a personal thing.

Pretty much everything. The optional Bang & Olufsen sound system sounds amazing. The MMI is simple and intuitive. The leather is great to the touch. In short: absolute quality!

The Package!!



Motor and Quattro.
