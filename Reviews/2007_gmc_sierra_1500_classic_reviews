the 38 gal. fuel tank,dual a/c,and 17''tires

The ride, the quiet cab, as well as the steering wheel controls for the stereo which I never though tI would appreciate.

Cost affordable

It's hard to name just one, I like the DVD to keep the kids busy, the roominess, so everyone isn't on top of each other. I have more options than a Denali and it cost a lot less.

This truck is loaded so a favorite feature is hard to single out. I think the overall vehicle is my best feature.

Smooth, quiet ride. Smooth transmission. Interior with simple, self-explanatory controls. Acceleration. Amazing brakes for a truck

Excellent quiet ride. Body styling will last for years to come. Roomy interior. Back seat passengers always make good remarks about the amount of space.

Lay out of gauges. Driver information center. Auto dimming mirrors. Sound system.

Extended sun visors, engine hour meter, 17" rims and 245 rubber. Having all the gauges is wonderful feature for many drivers.

The smooth quiet ride. Roaring engine when needed.

Love the room in the cab, the handling, and the smooth ride the truck provides.
