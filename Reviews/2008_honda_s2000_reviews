Transmission/ shifter; the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the VTEC engine; which, contrary to a previous review, does not have less power than previously. The U.S. formula for computing HP in 07 resulted in an apparent decrease of 3 HP, though nothing was changed. The unglitzy cabin quality is great. 

V-Tec and a terrific gearbox. And one sweet sound from the exhaust.

I love a roadster with an adequate trunk and the electric top is a nice touch compared to my Toyota mr2.

The suede seats. And the slick body style. It feels good to drive

Power Train; VTEC Engine, Gearbox shifting, fantastic suspension.

Engine. Suspension setup. 50/50 balance.

The engine sound (intoxicating), seat comfort, ergonomics of controls, fast top, handling, and most of all- the best shifter in the industry

Engine note over 6k RPM, handling!!!, and the absence of wind rumble with the top down and windows up. Occupants are comfortable top-down, windows up, at 55 degrees, mid-heat setting with fan off.

There were few changes from 2007 to the 2008 s2000. One of my favorite & selling points for the 2008 over the 2007 are the rims. The multiple spoke of <2008 models are just not my style & make it much more difficult to clean. Parts of the interior door panels changed along with minor dash displays.

Seats are great, mid-range power is good, can shift from 1-2-4-6 no problem and well under 5k rpm. Also, the brakes and handling a just crazy. Honda usually does not have good red color, however the new formula red is the color to have!

Very tight!

Its the handling stupid! Although this is a smooth and civilized beast with just enough features for comfort and a growl and exhaust note that is very satisfying to the caveman in all of us, it is the solid handling of this ethyl- eater that gets you. Road feel and predictability are excellent.
