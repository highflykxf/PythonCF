Sound System, Blue Tooth, XM all work great. Very happy with the exterior looks and interior versatility. I camp, mountain bike, carpool etc... and it's very capable in all areas.

Quality, gas mileage, appearance, premium sound system.

Oil filter access and ride.

4x4 system, technology system.

Value, quality,solidly built vehicle. especially like the R/F sound system and the Blue Tooth phone. Engine is powerful and reliable.

Looks, ready to rock and roll like a Transformer. The engine sound when you turn the transformer on. The sound system. The am here to kick butt not to just look good attitude. The fact that everyone knows that there is more that meets the eye. The utility of the beast. It Rocks like no other.

Off road lights, hill ascent and descent, off road clearance, steering wheel audio/bluetooth controls, pretty much everything else too

I love all the tie downs, the hard plastic rear and the muddy storage in the back and in the roof rack. Sound system and bluetooth, Good visibility and power. Fully loaded the S is a great performer and you can get a good deal on one.

For under 30k you got something that really goes. Can chirp tires when you hit second. And it can go off road,even has a low range and a locker.

Power, handling, towing, great driving vision, sits up high, stereo system.

The looks, and Nissan isn't going to stop making the Xterra any time soon!!

Love it all!

Every thing about this car is a favorite.
