Psychological gratification of driving a hybrid, Lexus service

The nav, slingshot acceleration, gorgeous fit and finish, a real pretty car.

Active handling option, park assist.

Speed, style, and luxury.

The engine.

Awesome power at any speed. The quiet is something to behold. It is almost like floating!

This is my third GPS/Nav, and by far the best I have seen. Take a look even if you have rejected them in the past. The Bluetooth integration is great. There is outrageous power at all speeds. Its "rolling start" - more typical of daily use -is even superior to its 0 to 60. Great transmission.

Absolutely the fastest car from 80 to 100+ I've ever owned. The transmission is exceptional & don't miss the down shifting in manual mode. Fit & quality are "Lexus".

Radar collision control, almost drives itself.

Bluetooth speaker, navigations, DVD player, 14 speaker stereo, full programmability - a lot of toys keep you busy for hours.



The whole hybrid thing. No "iDrive" type joystick garbage. Simple easy to use features. Nice GPS display. 

Exterior looks - interior luxury and functionality - great sound system.

Unbelievable power and performance. Very quiet. Excellent Mark Levinson stereo.

Easy start button, blue tooth technology and back up camera.
