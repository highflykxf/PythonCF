Safety features were a huge plus for us, all the extra room is great, fun to drive overall love it

everything. specially cargo room and the dvd and sunroof

Powerful stereo system .. memory seats .. Very good gas mileage considering 4000+ vehicle weight Never got less then 18mpg city ... 27 mpg hgwy 

The built in DVD, excellent stereo system, pretty interior design.

It's unique considering that when we go out, we will see dozens of Odysseys, Siennas, and Dodge/Chryslers. Powerful, smooth, quiet, and comfortable. Tilting side mirrors when reversing. Power rear popout rear windows. Impressive 13 speaker Infinity 660W sound system.

I love the convenience of the stowing away of the back seats. Managing the controls in the steering column and the compass is a plus. The sound system is a plus, the surround sound is great. 

Three zone climate control, power side doors and all of the safety equipment. Fold away rear seats.

Comfy,love the automatic doors, Love the beep detection for the rear.

side auto doors, space, comfort, the fold down mirror that lets me keep an eye on whats going on in the back! the way the seats come out and fold down to make room for hauling different items. 

good mileage and exterior.

Large front windshield. Automatic doors. Windows that roll down on side doors. Smooth ride. 

The Entire minivan is enjoyable ride and it has great pick up from 0-60 mph.For the price you can't get a better minivan!

Automatic doors Power outlets Luggage rack Ease of access and egress

The room and the automatic doors

favorite feature is all the room there is in this van,and the way the dash board is laid out,easy to reach everything
