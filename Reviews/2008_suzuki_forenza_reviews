Looks and style.

I loved everything about it.

Styling, reliable, great standard equipment.

Styling is better than average, lots of amenities for a low priced car. This car had power everything.

the drive in it



The only thing I really liked about my Forenza was the performance. It was slow to respond but when it did you were out of sight. 

Honestly, nothing

MP3. Spacious space. Spacious compartment. 

Style. Lumbar support. MP3 input. Price. Size. And the brights are fantastic!

Everything on my car.

The car is comfortable and fun to drive.

I do like the steering wheel controls and the new grill style - but that is all, the rest feels like a cheap little normal car. 

The whole package seems nice to me. I can't think of any one thing I could call a favorite.

All the stereo controls are right at your finger tips. Air bags on driver and pasenger come with front and side. Seats four adults easy. Very big trunk.

MP3 jack. Controls in arms reach. Gas tank cover only opens via auto release. Large trunk.

Nice design, all controls make sense and are nicely located. Lots of features and extras, and a killer warranty. Tons of trunk space, fold down back seat is a nice touch.
