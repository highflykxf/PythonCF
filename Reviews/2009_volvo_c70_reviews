appearance inside and out, iPod interface, driver seat comfort and adjust ability

Waiting for the weather to get much nicer so that I truly enjoy the open top experience.

Hard Top, Smooth handling, quiet engine, styling, acceleration and handling in normal driving, Blue tooth phone connection, Great trunk for a convertible. 5 speed automatic transmission is very smooth



Keyless entry is an awesome feature. it is kind of strange to not have to worry about doing anything to open or start the car. The sound system is GREAT. I am hearing some portions of tracks that I swear I have never heard before and it is so clear even when turned up all the way on an open road.

Nav and audio are both great. Like the hands free key.

Great MPG on Reg. Fuel, Quality of Build, Style.

The sound system is superb. We like that you can customer set the surround sound. The speakers in the back seat "tickle your bottom" if the song has a strong base. This car is meant for cruising! The design of the valet key is SMART. I LOVE THIS CAR!

hardtop convertible

The hardtop roof, trunk space is awesome for a convertible

The retractable hard-top is great. Operates quickly and looks so much better than a rag-top convertible.

Styling. Fantastic sound system. Big trunk and backseat. 

Broad shouldered styling,a dynamic audio system, and the slick folding roof design should keep any convertible lover happy. Handling is another strong feature of the Volvo C70. Also, the C70 runs nicely on regular unleaded.

Huge trunk. Smooth 6 speed shifting. Nice dolby speakers
