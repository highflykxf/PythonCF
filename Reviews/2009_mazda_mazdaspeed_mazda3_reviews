Power, handling, brakes ... mostly the fact that the car always seems to make people smile.

Gas Mileage well over rated specs. Exhaust note. It sounds like a turboprop aircraft when you lift off the gas. Very cool.

Handling, brakes, turbo!!

The predominant feature is the breath taking acceleration. Next is the truly excellent handling on curves. The quick and precise steering lends to the feeling of control when hard cornering is in process. The drivers accommodations are excellent and comfortable. The seats are exceptional!

Goes very fast.

Telescoping wheel, HID and LED lights with auto function, fog lights, trunk light (not sure why one reviewer said there wasn't one), electronic headlight positioner, nice gauge display, massive glove box, aux audio jack, lots of cup holders, driver's cockpit fully adjustable for the short and tall.

Styling, power, nimble handling and the exhaust note. It's solid and reliable performance with refined styling. And did I mention the power and the handling. 

turbo, steering, brakes, suspension, climate control, seats (although a bit short), roomy interior, practical as a daily driver. 

Exhaust note, braking, acceleration, handling. TRUE RED!!

6 speed manual, performance

Very supportive Alcantara/leather seats, very powerful motor with an amazing amount of torque, attractive looks and great practicality, automatic windshield wipers, HID lights, True Red color (one of the brightest reds I've ever seen)

Obviously the ridiculous amount of power it produces. Climate control, Seats, sound of the exhaust, the aftermarket customizability of it. The ability to be a sports car and cargo carrier.

All the performance aspects... that's why someone will buy this car after all!!

MPG computer, auto climate control, throaty exhaust, no turbo lag, lots of torque, comfy seats, 6 CD MP3 changer, aux input, HID and LED lights, price
