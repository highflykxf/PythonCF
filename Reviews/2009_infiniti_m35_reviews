The car itself is beautiful and has a really nice ride.

The car is great - instant throttle response, amazing handling, quiet ride, all the technology and 14 speaker sound. The music box is great, just drop in a CD and it records and stores it on the hard disk, up to 2900 songs! Also, it is the largest and easiest to get in and out of in it's class! 

Handling, power, features and looks. Trouble free.

Room, controls, LED lighting, solid V6

SAT Radio, the new 303bhp engine and the power that comes with it, the smooth ride, and styling. 

Power, acceleration, handling, rear wheel drive, bluetooth, voice command, exhaust note, smart key high quality feel and look, heated and cooled seats.

Heated/Cooled seats, Back up camera, handling, beautiful leather & wood trim interior, BOSE sound

I hate this car with all the cheap plastic parts that RATTLE.

The 5.1 surround sound is too much fun although you have to buy designated music DVDs. The regular sound is excellent, too. The back up camera is a huge plus.

Sound system with hard drive, nav system, heated/cooled seats standard and solid but comfortable ride. Corners like a Mini.

Dashboard, tail light design, navigation system control, African rosewood interior, "cornering lights" that automatically move the direction you turn, Infiniti embroidered logo on seats, and the air conditioned/ heated leather seats. Also the push button start is very "James Bondish" in my opinion.
