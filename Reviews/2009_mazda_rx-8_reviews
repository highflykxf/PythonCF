Handling, very stable at any speed, easy to drive, wonderful gear box, comfortable for sports car, smooth and sweet engine sound, unique, special, classy.

Engine (once you understand it) Handling (FANTASTIC!) Roomy, for a sports car. Doesn't slow at hills at hiway speeds, like most cars do. Style - Just 'weird' but lovable Ride - Not too stiff, not soft at all Ease of use - The whole console may be reached without stretching, even for short folk

Is great car to drive, be nice if it could hold its own in a straight run from the lights rather than just luck pretty - but does corner well. Does not live up the the rx7 blood lines. Plus anyone notice the average age of the people buying ... puts a dent in the ego :)

Suspension, wheels, recaro seats

The "performance" pieces: 18" wheels, & the strut tower brace. The outer styling has kinda grown on me too. I was already used to the engine and all. And BTW, I'm getting better gas mileage (25-26mpg highway + city) than I got with my 300hp 3rd gen (abou 23-24mpg).

Rotary Engine, Brakes, Transmission...Everything.

I needed a third seat for a year old for one, 2000 mile trip, and compared to a rental car and insurance in Mexico, this was a good solution. But, aside from occasional use, not much of a back seat here... and not much of a sports car either.

Styling, handling, fit/finish, styling

The handling is superb and the stereo system is killer. The seats literally hug your body. The exterior stance is wide and low, it simply is a great looking car.

Engine, smooth ride, sounds great, picks up fast too.

Superior engine and transmission, great sound system and the ability to haul along the in-laws. :>)
