Smart key, remote start, DVD/nav. and very quiet ride instrumentation are great and easy to read, blue tooth is wonderful.

power train, smart key, the smooth suspension, KDSS, crawl control

With 5000 miles on my cruiser I am happy to say I have no squeaks or rattles which I believe is all in the fit and finish with quality materials.

Handles well and feels solid. Cool box, and plenty of room.

The engine power, 4 zone climate control, the navigation,cooler box, rear dvd package, the "balanced" suspention gives excellent ride quality.

Excellent ride on and off road. Excellent acceleration, I feel that I am in a sport car (other than the cornering).

To me this is a more hardened and more powerful version of LC with better fit & finish than any other LC to date. I am open-minded & really like the new styling.

This suv is tight in every way without leaving out comfort. 

Big V8 Big brakes

The navigation system us very user friendly. The cooler box is cool and the whole computer system is great if you can figure out how to use it all. Heated back seats.

Display monitor with fancy buttons, maps, GPS, and much more.
