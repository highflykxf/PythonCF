DVD entertainment system.

6 speed manual trans (as good as any BMW I have owned), AMG Wheels look great, standard Bluetooth, climate control

The nav and mutlimedia system is great .. everything about this vehicle is super !

Sports car feel...looks awesome....fold down seats perfect and a must! Very comfortable and never tired of driving it!

Multimedia package. Superb sound and features. Love the voice command and blue tooth.

Engine, Electronic package, Rarity of an AMG 

Very refined driving experience; excellent ride, noise suppression, solid-feeling car. Great styling. Very reasonably priced. Base stereo sounds great (plays mp3s); didn't need GPS, saw no need to go with expensive multimedia package.

Sound system is excellent (much more bass and 150 more watts than Lexus Mark Levinson), navigation, fit and finish, styling, handling, ride comfort. Despite complaints about rear seat legroom and trunk space, it has more than the IS350, and I can now fit average size adults in the back seats.

exterior appearance, 4Matic, smooth ride, quick passing acceleration

memory seats, one-touch windows, auto-dimming mirrors, 

THE MOTOR the POWER the MOTOR

The ride is superb. This alone will make you want to buy this vehicle. I gave this car 10 for build quality.

None really. 

style/sportiness/solid feel

Exterior and interior design as well as all of the list of upgrades that you can add to this model, oh yeah and the Harmon Kardon sound system is AMAZING.

The voice activated NAV works great. So does the Bluetooth, but it won't import my phone book like my 2007 E did. Car has less body roll than my E Class did...that's a plus!

Beautiful, powerful yet gracious, comfortable, can go on and on!

Style, features

Bluetooth phone, navigation, SOLID handling. This car handles better than some SUVs in the snow! Also, the car is super stable and the ride is phenomenal!!

The multimedia system is great and the bluetooth system is clear. The stereo is like a theater system.

The exterior design. This is the main reason I bought C300. Aggressive front face and dual exhausts in rear face.

Front grille, voice control, navigation, very good sound system with many features, including flash drive and iPod integration (upgraded)

Navigation System, Exhaust tone, Music Register

Design, peformance, great sound system.

Interior, the well organized cabin, silence in a cabin, plus all the handy comands

Gas mileage is excellent for a V6. About 23 mpg overall mostly stop-and-go Florida traffic. COMAND system is much better than previous versions in other models and much more intuitive than idrive. Build quality is excellent, it seems MB is making strides in quality/reliability improvement.

V6 engine mated to a manual transmission. Interior material. Driveability. 



Acceleration. Comfort. Smooth ride.

Really everything, but expecially the ride quality and the COMAND system.

Great exterior looks (lots of stares in US), ride and handling, strong brakes, smooth and powerful engine and transmission, MultiMedia system, Bluetooth cell-phone integration.

Exterior design. Glass roof is unique. Decent trunk size. Good front seat comfort and leg room. Good A/C. 

The stereo is amazing, it brakes better and has far more traction than my other 4 wheel drive cars. The seats are comfortable yet firm, the controls are in the perfect places. The engine is quiet and road noise control is excellent. The quality of the materials are very high.

The way it drives and downshifts right when you want it to. On highway 85MPH is smooth. The handling. The ease of use of the navi, phone, and stereo. The pop-up screen. The way it looks. People stare at this car. From the front it looks great. MPG better than advertised. Takes E85. Very safe car. 

Multimedia package is great in all aspects.

Between voice command, buttons on the center dash, buttons on the steering wheel and a mouse dial that can be used to navigate the center screen ? there are about 4 different ways to access and control the navigation system, radio, video, and CD/DVD player. Fun!

Ride, manual transmission, looks inside and out, navigation.
