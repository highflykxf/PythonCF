Everything and did I mention 510 HP, 531 foot pounds of torque mated to the 030 Performance Package? Wow, what a car!

The folding hard-top is a work of art to watch at work; SL55 is a great blend of aggressive performance and beautiful luxury in one package. Nice job, MB! The first MB I've owned, but not likely to be the last.

510 HP, panoramic roof in the convertible, pulse seating, amazing turn radius. 

The hard-top lowered or raised in about 16 seconds. Very effective wind management with the top down.The articulating rear window rotates to snug up to the roof maintaining over 7 cu/ft of storage in the trunk. The trunk is pretty large with the top up with over 10 cu/ft + 6 more behind the seats.

The 7 speed auto-transmission can be changed from comfort to sport for all- out sports car performance. Great V8 - very smooth with incredible low range torque and power. Hard top folds into trunk but only takes 3 of its 10 cu/ft. Still 6-7 cu/ft behiind the seats. Bottom line-its fun!

Quality build

Motorized hard drop-top, Keyless Go, voice control, awesome acceleration, still one of the best looking cars out there

Obviously the retractible top. Styling and handling

Engine power and torque provide great acceleration and the improved steering makes you feel like you're hard wired to the car. Watching the top perform its contortion act is great entertainment. 

Firm coupe with the top up. Solid, heavy and quick. Consistant. AMG wheels and grill, very distinctive. Real GT tourer. Like the fact that the CD changer shuffles across all discs.

Retract. panoramic roof, very responsive power and handling, great looks and comfortable interior. 

The whole package.

Driving feel, looks, hard top convertible

Amazing combination of sporty yet comfortable ride. Incredibly flat cornering. Panaoramic top. Very quiet with top up. Great looks.

The hardtop roof into the trunk. The glass panel in the roof is great. The exterior styling, and I just really enjoy driving.

Power hard top, engine, and transmission 

Hard top convertible cool. Bluetooth phone good. 

Top retracting is awesome

Top up down time and movement. Styling, and seats.

Keyless-go, where the keys stay in your pocket is a terrific option. So is the integrated blue-tooth technology, where the car "senses" your cell phone, and you operate it through the stereo and speaker system.

Glass roof (panorama)--Cheap, flimsy sunscreen though. Fast (16 sec) convertible hardtop--can't drive while operating it like Porsche 911 & BMW 650. 12 posititon, Ventilated seats w/massage. Tiny compartment underseats for storage. Trunk closer button. Groove on gas-lid for gas-cap. Good windscreen.

The way the car drives. It is incredible.

The increased horsepower gives this car the extra acceleration it lacked before. The cornering foglights are a pleasent surprise and work very well. The bluetooth phone is simple to use and works perfectly, even with the top down, at all speeds.
