It accelerates smoothly and has a nice quiet ride. The steering is tight (excellent turning radius). Huge breaks... stops on a dime!

The "snow" drive button option. The extra power button engine option. The exterior look. Sound system 

Comfortable seats, smooth ride, paddle shifters, fit and finish.

Interior fit and finish. Exterior styling. Instrument panel. Air conditioned seats. Puddle lamps. Excellent handling and smooth engine/transmission. Extremely quite and luxurious. Great handling. Very comfortable seats - even for long distances. Good gas mileage.

Nice exterior design, solid handling, little body roll, 204 HP has decent torque range, good highway gas mileage, good lumbar support. Reviews of AWD suggest good traction in snow but since I may be forced to trading the car in after only 1k miles and is still summer, I'll never know.

all of the creature comforts as well, as classy, upscale styling.

Ventilated from seats; style, sound system and layout of the dashboard. The sound and navigation systems beat the BMW hands down. The quality of the leather is superb. Gas mileage is very good and is the primary reason why I chose a 250 instead of a 350. 

I love the exterior design, and the interior is the great quality, smart keyless, good value. 

Fun vehicle to drive, great looking car, all wheel drive is great in snow, reasonable gas mileage.

Great nav system with hi-res screen, great low-light backup camera, beautiful dash and gauges, nice keyless solution including touch sensitive handles. Great looking from front and sides (not rear). Controls and usability are kept clean due to touch screen.

Optitron meters, which turn orange when you are more than your set speed limit to alarm you of the high speed, nice base 13 speaker sound system, nice punch to it. Good acceleration but come on its 2.5 L, if you are really that acceleration fan then buy IS 350 but that doesn't have the RWD. Cozy int.
