Power!

I love the fact that the trailer brake box is built into the dash. So, no ugly box hanging down to knock your knee on. The second fact is the six speed automatic. I like you can put it into manual mode to shift it like a manual for the steep hills. 

Duramax Diesel/Allison 6-Speed Automatic Tranny.

love the power! Integrated trailer brakes- why was this not done years ago?

The interior has a nice look and feel. Gotta feel good when your in a truck as long as I am.

Sunroof, interior (that's what you see the most), smoothness and of course, power!

Bose speaker system, interior design has all kinds of room and is very attractive yet tough! Rubber floor mats was an excellent idea. Remote start for the cold mornings and hot days!

Power! Interior is not too shabby, have a little better than a 2LT but not as much as an LTZ

LTZ interior, navigation, sunroof, Duramax/Allison combo unbeatable. 

Duramax/Allison

The interior and ride was what sold me. The diesel can pull more than anything I will ever need to pull. And it's a very queit motor once warmed up.

Without a doubt: Duramax/Allison. This is by far the best light diesel drivetrain on the market. Test drive them all; you'll see. I still have respect for Cummins. None for Powerstroke. My interior is very nice. Wish it had the LT2 cloth but could not live without bench seat in extended cab.

Interior comfort, rides much better than '05 2500HD

Smooth ride, caddy-like interior, comfy seats, sunroof, remote start with temp sensor, I could go on.

Remote start, steering wheel controls, and locking differential

Looks great, runs quiet

Desert Brown metallic - nice color Duramax engine - excellent power Interior layout - very well done

The ride, build quality, style

the ride

Big diesel right off the shelf. Don't need no chip.

6.0 motor has plenty of power

Chevrolet adding The LTZ with all of the interior changes are my favorite parts of this truck
