The interior of our car is its best feature. We have the two tone ivory/black leather, with dark ash wood and chrome trim. The fit and finish and overall look is outstanding. The interior looks better than most $100K cars.

Fun to drive, plenty of power, beautiful car. Luxurious.



Pretty much everything, but if I had to pick one, the engine performance.

Engine and brakes. Stereo is pretty decent.

Performance, handling, looks and trunk space.

Looks, handling, trunk space for such a small car.

The engine, the suspension, the comfortable seats.



I especially like the agressive pick up and the seating. The car still feels solid and safe at any speed.

The automatic and effortless convertible top makes it easy to open and close.

Luxuriousness as well as the feeling of cruising comfortably while at high speed. Power.

The engine. Also very quiet for a cabriolet. Top down it is quieter than a 350Z with the top up.

Top up/top down ease of use

Body style. Pure beauty.

The wrap feel when the top is down and the light, bright ceiling.

Ease of lowering and raising top. Ability to adjust seats. Comfort of seats is excellent. Place for glasses is good.

Gushing power and handling. Smells great as well!

Engine. Transmission. IPod integration. Trunk is surprisingly large. Back seat is surprisingly large.

Great interior. Clean and classic. Wonderful engine, excellent muffler note, and love the convertible.
