Loaded with the Premium Stereo, Blue Tooth with iphone is awesome and clear; shift paddles on the steering wheel; head up display. The seats are very comfortable...get the upgraded multi-contour option...well worth it on a long drive. I love everything about this car. 

Handling and ride quality.

Throaty Twin Turbo V8, Exterior Styling

Like the unique look and the fact that I have yet to see another one on the road. Handling is superb.

Road handling and seating is exceptional. Incredible audio system. Back-up camera enhances rearward visibility. Electric tailgate is a great convenience.

Comfort, handling, high seat position and planted feel on any road surface. The drive is better than anything out there including X5.

Beautiful interior, two tone nevada leather. Love the bluetooth feature, don't know how I got along without it. The Idrive was easy to master and helpful. Smooth and quiet on the road.

I LOVE the way the blue tooth works with my cell phone. Almost forgot what it's like NOT to have it.

Road handling, adaptive head lights, extensive safety features, sound and power of engine.

No question...twin turbo. Excellent acceleration, handling...well, just perfect driving in general. 

DPC/XDrive, sport mode, 19 inch wheels, Nappa Leather, Comfort Seats, RT Traffic Nav, enough utility for me, Ipod integrated premium stereo, fat steering wheel, awesome brakes, looks aggressive from most angles, DVD changer, PDC works well, Monaco Blue Metallic paint, Bluetooth, running boards.

Tracks like a train on tracks

Handling, speed, and that BMW trade mark engine note. Logic7 is not the best but still in the top tier. Looks - I, just like all the others passing by, stop in front of the car and smile everyday.
