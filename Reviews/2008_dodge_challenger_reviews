Looks, Drive, Comfort, reliability, social magnet.

Styling, ridiculous power, keyless ignition, almost complete lack of exterior chrome, square tailpipes.

Everything! Sound system, performance, looks and creature comforts.

Style



Power, comfort, sound system, safety features, F-1 tires, milage and the admiration of the general public.

HEMI BABY. Looks great. Shiftable Auto still getting used to it though. The F1 tires hold really well, almost to well read below. Breaks really good too.

Hands free, touch screen navigation, Sirius Radio, and all the memory for music. Seat are very comfortable. Performance data recording.

UConnect and StickShift

Power, handling, & great looks. All the attention you get from most people who see it for the 1st time is unbelievable.

retro headlights

0-60 in 4.7 sec. Beautiful retro styling back to the '70 Challenger

The push button start, MyGig Media Center, and the deep rumble of the exhaust.

The shifting and power are my favorite things about this retro style muscle car.

No doubt about it..the Exterior makes the car. Love the front and rear look of the car. Nice sound and a real nice interior compared to my vette and Shelby GT 500. Has Great seats, nice sunroof and radio/NAV setup. The car rides real smooth. Excellent braking. The Hemi Orange paint.

big power great sound ! 

The body frame. It's not about curves, it's about brute strength and horsepower (something the SRT8 has plenty of).
