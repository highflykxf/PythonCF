Handling is great. Styling and front seats are also way above average.

Great handling. Excellent braking. Bluetooth is awesome. Comfortable driving position.(I'm 6'4"-but nobody wants to sit behind me!!) Great Bose Stereo w/ Satellite Radio. Excellent utility. Security of AWD. Very good safety ratings.

Sporty yet comfortable feel.

Fun to drive (Zoom Zoom!) Sleek interior, lots of room all-around (front, back, back storage) Love the look and the feel of driving this car. It gets better than the mileage advertised. We travel quite a bit and are getting about 25/26 miles to a gallon, which is great...comparable to the CR-V. 

The Bose system is great unbelievable sound.

Acceleration and quality of construction for a $23K car, not bad. I think the car looks good too and it has a sporty feel when driving. Quite impressed. We aren't talking a BMW here, just a solid, quick steering, inexpensive vehicle.

I love the engine, the stereo bose sytem rocks and the car is sleek!

Good power, excellent handling. Keyless entry/ignition. Xenon lights. Sporty interior layout, Blue on red interior light scheme. Stand out styling. Car for the money.

Everything

Exterior styling. Room to haul stuff and still look cool.

Great acceleration and great looking. Handles well, Bose system and Bluetooth are flawless. Comfortable seats.

Interior and the performance. For an SUV it gets excellent gas milege. I average 25-28 mpg so far. Depends on how often I drive in town. Just a great SUV with power everything. 

Performance from the turbo, no turbo lag that I can feel

Stereo, navigation, looks, handling, performance. If you don't get AWD, the car rocks!

Exterior styling, ample room.
