lane change warning, voice activated nav system, in cruise control the auto pacing is great, sound system is great seats are very comfortable, dash lighting very easy on the eyes

The car is very comfortable inside. The extras like rear view camera, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, 9.1 Gig hard drive, DVD player, user friendly navigation, the surround sound is the best I have ever heard. I still look forward to the drive to work. Mood lighting. Seats are comfy

The acceleration. This car can move. The compact flash, hard drive and satellite radio, gives you loads of entertainment options. The surround sound is simply awesome. I am 240lbs and 6 feet tall and this car is comfortable. I enjoy taking long drives in it.

The rearview camera is awesome, the sound system is incredible, the interior design and layout are very attractive and the seats are very comfortable. Also love that Infiniti puts thought into the design of their rims. 



My favorite features of this car are all of the technology items. The lane departure warning and prevention systems are awesome. The intelligent cruise control is also great. I do a lot of driving to Vegas and Salt Lake City and I appreciate the adaptive front lighting system with HID headlamps.

Incredible interior, excellent technology, love the hard drive for storing music, big navigation display, lots of room, and very good power and acceleration.

Beautiful interior, good power, nav, satellite radio, reliable technology (computer and mechanical)

Technologies such as a built in hard drive, compact flash and the best interface and visual navigation system are what clearly help separate the M45 apart. The interior design is excellent and build quality is superior.
