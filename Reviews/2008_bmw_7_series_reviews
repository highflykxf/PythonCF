smooth acceleration and great handling for such a big auto



DVD sound system! Stereo! IDrive is too cool. Smooooooth ride. Luxury, comfort, and feel.

IDrive, luxury seats with tons of features and everything else this car has to offer. Once you are in driver's or passenger's seat you don't want to step out. My kids love the rear comfort seats and these seats can also be adjusted just like the front.

Excellent rear seat adjustment options and lots and lots of leg room. Good seat memory function - also in the back. 

Great engine, smooth transmission, comfortable front seats and interior, smart dashboard design, balanced ride, sharp handling.

Awesome seat comfort and lots of leg room in the back seat for tall people like myself.

Handling, ride, handling, ride

Seating, leather quality, steering wheel, great climate control (air conditioning is strong) and rear window shades help keep car cool, good storage in front of car, beautiful designed interior.

You gotta drive it on the highway and cruise!

Handling, ride, quality.

Handling, interior, overall design. I love the iDrive which I know some find difficult. It's the third one for me and other cars seem boring in comparison.

Ride, handling, reliability so far, build quality, technology, love the night vision, and pretty good fuel consumption for a larger sedan

Handling, fuel economy, performance, comfort, design, and almost everything.
