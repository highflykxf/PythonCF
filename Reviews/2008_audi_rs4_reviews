Acceleration, build and quality.

It accelerates like a rocket! As soon as it warms up outside I am going to take to the local drag strip and see what numbers we can get it to turn! 

The interior.

Power, non-flashy looks, relatively unknown as far as performance cars go, interior design - and much more!

Stealthy appearance - I have the titanium package which removes some of the differentiating features compared to the A4. Engine is phenomenal as above with a great sound. Usual Audi quality interior. Four season capability.

Performance, ride handling/control, brakes, quattro, interior luxury, and not too in your face. Only car enthusiasts will recognize it!

I love the understated nature of the car (though it receives many quick "double takes"). I wanted an extraordinarily fun car to drive that is mature and mildly sporty (looking). In terms driving, I can't say enough about the low speed comfort. High speed goes without saying.

Sound of exhaust. They hit it right. Short throw stick great, Engine torch, just wants to keep going. Handling is great. All smiles fun factor guaranteed.
