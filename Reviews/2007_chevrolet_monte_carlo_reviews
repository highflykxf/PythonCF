Onboard information center. Lumbar support. Handles great

fwd has gotten me out of some sticky situations so i don't mind it. the length gives you the feeling of being in a larger car 

The 5.3 engine is great. The wider body style gives it an aggressive stance. Plenty of room for anyone. The long doors would be perfect to add lambo hinges.

The speed and the roominess, great for long distance driving.

The best feature that works well is the remote start. 

Overall looks and comfort, it is a head turner.

Looks, performance, mileage. I receive comments from strangers all the time on what a beautiful car. A few Mustang owners have been surprised - guess they thought there was a V-6 under the hood. Sweet!

How fast the 5.3 engine is, also the handling of the car overall. What a car GM made so well. 

Everything!



Seamless power

Gas mileage, comfort and looks.

5.3 LS-4 with 303 hp very quick when pedaled to the floor. Flawless engine management with 4 cyl mode which gives good mpg of 20.6 city. Heated leather seats. Power moon roof. Excellent controls for lights, heat/AC, stereo

Speed. It's really fast. Roomy and very comfortable. And I love the looks.

Wide comfortable seats. New looks are incredible. Brakes are incredible. Everyone loves the car appearance. Exhaust is one of the best systems around and enhances the overall perfromance feel of the car. Turn by turn OnStar.

Easy to read dash design and look.

All features at fingertip.

Cabin space, stereo, dual air conditioning

They're all good.

Power and acceleration

Instruments on steering wheel. The 6 CD player and the sound. The small areas to put thinging into. The trunk area is very large and is nice. 

Has to be the looks of the car and the speed

Awesome power for the money! Great styling, and powerful eye appeal! Large interior, and excellent sound system!

I love the power of the V8 engine.
