like the style and ride comfort, nav is easy to use, sound system is great too. reliability to date is good since I did not have to make any unplan trip to the dealer. Will give update at 10,000 miles 

Mileage, spacious interior, robustness, durability, braking, towing capacity, cleanliness of the Bluetec diesel (reduces my guilt), safety ratings.

Navigation (with traffic) total iPod intergration, bluetooth, amazing leather seats, backup camera, Sirius/XM, ride and most importantly GREAT fuel economy.

The steering is something that I can't put into words. Everything feels good in this car. Just close the door and listen. Turning radius is among the best.
