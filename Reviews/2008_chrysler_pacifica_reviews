It was a real lemon! And that's my favorite part! 

All the controls on the steering wheel! How cool is that. Leather



Interior is beyond spacious of a van, dashboard well designed, most definitely the knee space airbags for driver & front passenger, wow.....

Spacious, adjustable seating for driving a tilt wheel and good view all around for easy maneuvering

Great Interior with lots of room. Great dashboard setup. Wonderful handling and ride. Nice clean exterior design.

It rides great and easy to use radio & interior controls, Siruis radio makes another great feature. I always want to be driving!
