Powertrain Quality Appearance

Engine Comfort Class

Pros:solid build (feels like the car is carved out a block of steel, beautiful interior, HK stereo

The engine's 382 ponies.

The lowered front end, and 18" rims. Harman/Kardon Logic 7 sound system, leather interior, and huge back seat, and auto everything.

The badge really turns heads and makes you feel special. But the truth is that's all you get.

Sport AMG look; balanced smooth and refined ride; wood/leather steering wheel (!); powered perfectly for weight.

18" wheels, black exterior w/blk interior, black birdseye, audio system, trunk mounted Nav system that stays out of the way(just pop in the disc and forget about it), MB CPO inspection and 100k warranty, exterior design and the major "eye candy" factor. Everywhere I go this car is gawked at! 

Sport package is a must. Awesome rims, blue glass which is awesome with the white exterior and dove grey interior, more refined

Looks, handling, front seat passenger comfort and safety features.

Looks great, inside and out. Lots of torque. Great stereo.

Mercedes-Benz build quality - this car is solid, tight and incredibly well- built. I love (and have missed) that Mercedes vault-like 'thunk' when closing the doors, hood and trunk. Fuel economy and performance is excellent - 28mpg around town - no road trips yet, but can't wait!

Diesel. The best power plant I have driven in years. Great areas are the sound system, luxurious interior with real wood trim, and not faux metal, front seat comfort, and distinguished front end. The pre-safe technology makes me wonder how I lived without it. Reliability.

Performance, quality build.

Stereo rocks, blue tint is classy, heated seats are lux, engine growl is mean, leather is supple. Statement car absolutely. And the doors make a solid thud because they are so heavy. It's all the little things that you'll fall in love with.

4 matic in winter, great road feed back, yet quiet ride, bi xenon head light, comfortable seating

keyless, sat. radio, rear window shade, low emissions.

The fuel economy is great. Around Seattle (very hilly, lots of stop and go) I get 25MPG. On a recent trip to Phoenix the computer was reading 41.3 MPG on flat highways at about 60 MPH. At highway speeds a 700 mile tank of gas is no problem. Also, the car's service interval is 1 year!

Fuel economy. Speed. Acceleration

Styling, comfort, and security systems are all well- designed. Handles beautifully. 

Brand, performance, economy, silence in the cabin, service interval, service experience.

V6 diesel power, styling, comfort, quiet, mileage.

4-matic all wheel drive, great in the snow!

Distronic is cool although seems pretty useless unless you pay zero attention to the road ahead of you. The COMAND navigation is great and not as complicated as most poeple have claimed. Heated and ventilated seats are cool and the 4MATIC works great in New York's winter conditions and on rainy days

Power, smoothness of transmission, and design.

There's very little not to like about this car...good handling & accelleration, quiet smooth ride, solid build, excellent fit & finish, no-cost Sport pkg., COMAND navigation, Harmon Kardon sound system, 6 mos. free Serius satellite radio, underseat storage compartments, ambient lighting

Exceptional torque, superb 7 speed transmission, excellent interior and exterior design, first class MB engineering and build quality, comfort and safety features, accurate and quick steering, huge trunk, fold down rear seats, electronic trunk opener.

Performance, assembly quality. Requires very little maintenance.

Bluetooth, ease of operation of interior features, roominess of back seat and trunk

Love the sports package looks, quiet cabin, luxury 6 CD changer and radio. Hands free bluetooth is the best. You can control this from your steering wheel. The safety features are the best. Airbags, side airs and curtains. Safety should not be an option.

The ride, acceleration, comfort and feeling of safety. My last car was a gas guzzler, the Bluetec provides superb economy and performance

Paddle shifting though the gears and the explosiveness off the line. Being able to hit the rev limiter at 155mph and taking turns at 120mph at the AMG Challenge (Highly recommend if you are interested or have purchased a AMG model) 

Comfort, looks, performance, driving pleasure. 

No cost Sport option.

I love the Ipod integration kit--it works seamlessly with the car. The automatic trunk closer is terrific, and the phone and navigation systems work extremely well together. Also like the parktronic feature. Four zone temperature control and heated and ventilated front seats are great too.

Brake assist. Great stereo. Horsepower and acceleration. Interior.

For me everything is a favorite feature but the most I loved were the engine, transmission, the exhaust note, the handling and of course the looks. 

Blutec engine, 7 speed transmision ,speed sensitive steering, 28mpg city almost 40mpg Hwy 700 miles to empty wow!, comfort, quiet, Sirius satellite.

Now that the transmission problem is eliminated I can not think of anything I do not like about the Mercedes BLUETECH. Great handling, lots of power, very good mileage and comfortable ride. Additionally, the great service at my Mercedes dealer is making the ownership of this car even more enjoyable

Love the walnut trim. Seats are very comfortable. Steering wheel raises up to let you out. Harmon kardon sound system is the best. Nav shows you resturants and gas stations as you go along. It's like driving with google earth at your fingertips.

Powerful engine and smooth tranny

Voice command, navigation.

Great handling, improved apearance over 2005, quality workmanship, about 30 MPG fuel consumption in my daily driving, mostly rural/part city/some highway drivind. All highway driving 36 MPG

Beautiful workmanship. Seat comfort. Fold down rear seat. Multi-MP3 disk player. Razr specific Bluetooth adapter. The diesel engine is the real star - just amazing. You never get the feeling it's ever straining.

High tourque and great fuel economy

Bluetec. Pothole gobbling supple ride. Feels like a tank with a silk lining. Excellent luxury ride and yet solid feel. Enjoy the parktronic and P2 package. The torque is great. Why get the 350?

The 268hp, the gas mileage and the class Mercedes has.

Keyless entry/go. Bluetooth phone. Diesel engine (very quiet) Navigation, Sirius radio

Seats are very comfortable and the performance is great.

The handling on the open road is tight and performance in general have no regrets. The nav system. Until you have it you don't know what you're missing. The Sirius radio system complimented by the Harmon Kardon stereo is fantastic.

Great looks. It's built solid as a tank. Navigation system and satellite radio are very user friendly. 

The ride is terrific, but German, so if you want that float on a pillow feel, get a Lincoln Crown Vic or a Lexus. The nav system is excellent, but there is a learning curve which can be somewhat frustrating in the beginning, but stick with it, you'll get it.

Head turning looks when you pull up anywhere. Navigation system, sport package option is a must.

Adjustable suspension (sport v. comfort), heated and ventillated (not AC) seats, wood/leather steering wheel and the 18" AMG wheels. The car is definitely a looker and if you don't like who's looking, you can leave them in your dust. The NAV is intuitive, but the system in the trunk takes up width.
