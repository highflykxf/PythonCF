Has special paint & interior. Very sharp car.

Price.

Styling, Performance, American Made

0-60, what else?



Body Styling and matching interior, the car gets lots of looks.

price, mileage..........fun to drive.

Satellite raido is nice. All power options as standard a plus. The comuter display is great - I love the instant MPG display. I have a friend that bought the Scan Gauge for $300 that does what this does for free and looks right at home doing it.

My favorite features would have to be the intermediate shift feature on the automatics, and the outside of the car is very appealing to me compared to the Chevy Cobalt.

Great low fuel consumption, smooth ride and pretty quiet inside, great radio 260 watts

Colour, looks, large doors,radio and fuel economy

Appearance is the ONLY thing I like.

Remote start (for the presently bitter January here in the NE US.) 7 Pioneer speaker audio system with XM radio. Sharp looks - silver metallic with 17" aluminum rims! All in all - a sharp little car!

Everything about the car with the "My Link" and "Sun and Sound" packages makes me happy. It's a really comfortable car that I enjoy to drive. I'm constantly looking for excuses to go places in it.

The spoiler comes standard. Ipod jack. The looks of the car. Gas mileage. The smoothness of the ride.
