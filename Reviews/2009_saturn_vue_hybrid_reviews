in my car performance stinks, interior is nice, and exterior look is nice, that's why we got it but this whole MPG thing has made all of the pros not look so great any more...

the mpg gauge(average, and instant), all four individual tire gauge, hands free phone, xm radio, super large glove box

Styling. Interior and Exterior are gorgeous. Seems to be a very sturdy build, lots of room. 

I really like the way it looks and the gas mileage and the interior space.

Feature liked best ? everything. Vehicle has been very well thought out.Love the automatic wipers which come on when windshield is getting rained on, automatic lights are a plus, heated seats are therapeutic, especially on long drives. The phone/On-Star system is clear and easy to use-hands free.





XM radio. Chrome rims. Bluetooth. Fuel economy. Exterior looks. Quiet ride

So far I enjoy everything about the vue. Although my favorite feature would have to the amount of MPG it gets on the highway...31+

Good mileage along with good freeway power and mileage. Plus, made in the USA.

Mileage for a vehicle this size, Driver Info computer with tire pressure, MPG, etc. Mild hybrid system. Interior looks and features, exterior looks

Great fuel economy for vehicle this size, appearance inside and out, Driver Information Center (DIC), fold flat rear seats for cargo room, nicely equipped.
