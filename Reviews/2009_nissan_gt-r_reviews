Favorite feature is definitely stepping all the way down on the gas pedal on watching the car pull 1G and hitting 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds.

Suggested Improvements

This car corners like it is on rails. Very flat and stable. The grip is incredible. There's more power and torque than you know what to do with. Normal acceleration is effortless. 

The stereo system is great but tI bet the looks ion this car are the best features. I had people following me just to take a photo of this car. Last week a policeman stopped me just to ask me what kind of car I was driving. I never got that with a Porsche, Benz, BMW. Great looks!

Great performance for the money! Unique styling!

Everything it has!!!

Engine, BACK SEATS! (good enough for two car seats for the kids!), and price!

Engine. Tranny in paddle/manual shift mode. Brakes. Awesome multi-parameter electronic instrumentation

The shape, interior, fit and finish, performance, performance, performance!

Engine and transmission

Rims, HP, the steptronic is really accurate, mpg is not that bad for the performance - 23 mpg. 

Engine responsiveness and power. Controls easy to follow once you get used to them - no i-Drive complaints from me. Ride is surprisingly good over most road surfaces in Comfort mode, and the paddle shift controls feel/function perfectly. This car is very easy to drive at high speeds - great brakes.

Minimal turbo lag, super attention to detail, especially leather dash and door bits. Braking is stunning - I have to run red lights in fear that no other car behind me can stop as quickly as I can. Build quality is very good. Underside of car is completely sealed to reduce drag, which at .27 is low.

Transmission. Launch control. Obviously the twin turbos!
