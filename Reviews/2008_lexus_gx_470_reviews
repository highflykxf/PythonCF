Seat comfort, navigation system, stereo system and air ride.

Navigation, ride and comfort, high quality interior materials. 

V8 engine, seats, cargo space, quiet interior, Bluetooth, overall feeling of quality

Space inside, while small overall. Distinct look.

Heats up in a snap! Keyless start is a great option. Navigation is top notch with vibrant color screen and easy to use buttons. Seats are angled high so you're looking down towards the road, unlike the 4runner. Big side windows. Ultra smooth ride!

The interior is very nice, navigator/Mark Levinson stereo. 

Folding third row seats, Bluetooth and navigation.

Navigation and Bluetooth. Luxurious interior with the highest quality materials. Sporty yet luxurious look of the exterior. Graphite alloy wheels - they help hide dirt and brake dust. Adjustible suspension and height control.

The plush leather seats and that is about it.

Love the sound system and the ride on it is so smooth. We drove it from Kansas City on a 4 hour trip back to our home and the ride is phenomenal. The XM integration works wonderfully. Like the auto windshield wipers, too.

Nav is nice, good power, great quality for the price. Perfect ride for being 4wd capable.

Colors available are fantastic. Leather is real quality, navigation and sound system are incomparable, and the Lexus Link is a really special extra.

Reclining 2nd row for kids to sleep. Turning radius is great. Head room. Favorite feature is the change suspension option. Navigation system.

Hight position, nav with camera, Mark Levinson sound, iPod hook in and bluetooth.

The nav is top-of-the-line. Integrated Bluetooth works flawlessly with the RAZR. The leather is the highest quality we have encountered. Reclining rear seats are a plus. Seats 8, bring some friends along! Adjustable suspension (the sport mode is great on the highway - 4x4 does wonders off road).
