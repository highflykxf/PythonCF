Quiet, smooth, powerful ride. It's amazing how the vehicle has such smooth acceleration, smooth transmition, and almost "floating" ride yet very responsive stearing and handling. All the bells and whistles with the Denali package is nice too!!

Drivability, room, 4x4 in snow-great, mileage is better than I planned for- looks like 17.8-19.4 hwy, city is not great at 14.4. steering wheel controls- see below-love em wrong sides-flip em. 3x3 is the easiest I have ever worked before- 16k off MSRP-9k discount



Engine, interior comfort

Heated seats, heated wiper fluid, power start from outside the Denali. Engine power reminds me of my Stingray. Ride quality, room, power rear door, twenty inch tires, navigation, DVD, stereo, size, comfort, style, and more than I have space for here.

Power adjusting pedals, DVD player for kids,Plenty of room for a 240 lb 6'1" adult. Smoth ride with ridiculously comfortable seats, strong 5.3 litre flex fuel engine. Note:I have a 2005 Dodge Ram, 5.7 liter hemi. Me and my wife did some stoplight "racing" against each other..she stuck right with me!

Navagation, exterior design, interior comfort

Truck has great pick up for a large vehicle and handles very well. This truck is very comfortable and has a solid storage room.

Space is large but rear seats always interfere and are difficult and heavy to remove. Poor design. Navigation is cumbersome and fails to recognize street addresses which is highly frustrating. Ride is smooth but floats with numb steering. Seats comfy.

Power!
