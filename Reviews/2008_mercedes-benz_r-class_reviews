The kids love the Panoramic Sunroof. I enjoy the roominess as I'm 6 foot 3. My wife loves the automatic liftgate, opens up with a button and the kids just climb in the back. 7-Seat option is a must. I-Pod connector is cool.

Panoramic sunroof. Sound system is good and easy to use. 3rd row seats fold down easily. Safety and comfort. More rugged than expected in the snow.

I love the interior features very simple yet very nice. It seems very durable thus far. I like the sound system and the nav features are very easy to use. I like the address book that allows for phone numbers to be entered. I love the looks of this car. 

We like the 7 seating arrangement and fuel economy of the R320 CDI. We also like the panoramic moon-roof although we hardly ever open it in smog-congested Jakarta. The quiet Mercedes-Benz diesel engine is also a big plus as it can sometimes be a little bit mortifying to drive a noisy Benz. Well- done

Panoramic roof, auto rear hatch, safety, drive is smooth like butter, does not rock the kids like the BMW X series models, third row can really seat adults, can still move 2nd row seats forward to get to the 3rd row with 2 baby seats in place in the 2nd row. Bumper sensors, AMG stying

We have enjoyed having the back-up camera and the park assist feature. The leg room is short of incredible in this car. We opted for the P2 package, and I'm glad we did as it provides the Nav system and other nice features like the disk changer and I- Pod.

Automatic liftgate, hands free phone, parktronic laser letting you know if you're too close to an object when parking, power seats, quick touch cruise control and gear shifting, huge back trunk space when back seats are folded down, large spacious ride for 2nd and 3rd rows. My teens love this wagon.

Spacious interior for comfortably seating 7 people, interior design, park assist, memory seat and auto folding exterior mirrors 



The ParkTronic?s idiot proof system to help park your car. The automatic lift gate. No more unnatural, painful jerking of my wrists and thumbs to shut a back lift trunk door.

Handling, ride and power.

Love the panoramic roof giving the middle and back rows a glass ceiling. Unbelievably comfy and spacious seats in all rows. Auto open/close gate is nice. Backup camera (should be standard) is good as well. Park-assist beeps when close to cars in front/back and very useful.

Spacious interior for comfortably seating 6 people, interior design, back up camera, park assist, bluetooth, memory seat and auto folding exterior mirrors

Room, sat radio, I-pod Integration Kit 7-speed transmission, tele-aid, safety features, bucket seats, multifunction steering wheel controls, voice activation, blue tooth phone capability.

I love the panoramic roof with all the glass to see out. It makes sitting in the 2nd or 3rd seat seem much more open. The back-up camera is a great help along with the bumper sensors that let you know if you are coming too closs to an object. The seating is also very comfortable. 

Cavernous room in the interior. Even the third row is generous. MB quality, smooth yet sporty feel, panorama roof, backup camera, Nav system, michelin tires, easy access to the back row, parktronic, even the Smart Key is cool.

Motorized hatch with remote control - third row stow-away mechanism - interior design and rooom like S Class.

3rd row can seat adults in comfort. Panoramic roof has to be seen to be believed. My daughter can actually walk between the 2nd and 3rd row, when parked naturally. Solid throughout. I trust this car with my family's safety.

The seat arrangeament versatility, and the leg room. I like that the trunk door can be opened and close with the remote control. The radio and I-Pod connectivity are also easy to handle,

Easy access, automatic opening and closing of the trunk, i-pod connection, ability to operate many features on the steering wheel and the park-tronic.

Easy access, backup camera, navigation and the HK stereo which has 11 speakers, bass, Sirius, 6 disc changer and 450 watts. The hands free phone system with bluetooth module is outstanding! You can operate all of this from the steering wheel!

A lot of room inside, great seating expecially the 3rd row. My suggestion, pay the additional $ 1,000 for the Diesel and you will not regret the fewer trips to the gas station. Its a little noisier and slower upto the 20 MPH zone, but after that, you cannot differentiate from a gas engine.
