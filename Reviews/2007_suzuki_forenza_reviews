THE SIZE OF THE TRUNK

None I hate this car





Aux input on stereo system. Low cost.

5 speed, mp3 input on head unit

roomy trunk and am/fm/cd player. 



The stereo is the only thing about this car I actually kind of like.

Stereo





nothing 

Everything 

Roominess, gas mileage, exterior look, CD player with mp3 player capabilities. Good sound system too.

Cruise (I use a lot)



Lots of room, CD player/MP3.Exterior design is sharp, looks expensive

Roominess of the car. In it's class I think that it is actually one of the best. I for one like the exterior design also.

Good sound system, very stylish 

Cargo and people hauling. Styling, and looks much better with aftermarket wheels now. Storage space, interior design and audio performace. Cheap car with good warranty.

Interior comfort, reliability.



AM/FM/CD/cassette player - first time I've had all 4 in one stereo and the sound is fantastic. Gas mileage.

I like the airbags and the cd player.

Manual transmission, sporty look, ability to fit my 20" rims, trunk space.

Style. Standard power locks and windows. Great color red

Sunroof, classy look, backseat room, roomy trunk!

Roomy comfortable interior, great warranty, sporty appeal

The six airbags, stereo sound quality, fuel economy

The long bumper to bumper warranty, MP3 player, and sunroof.

The interior styling. It looks very slick for and inexpensive wagon. It has good build quality.

The car is built for safety. 



The styling.

The audio system and control panel.
