Third row window comes down, bucket seats in second row, nav. system, heated front seats, I got to admit everything about the Sequoia I like!!

DVD system with headphones. 

Plenty of room. Interior works well for my family. Comfortable to drive.

DVD, leather & heated seats.

I like looking at it and the drivers seat is very comfortable. Utilitarian wise it suits my needs.

None 

Smooth ride, always runs



Arctic Frost Pearl paint (BEAUTIFUL and unique color), NAV system (which I think works fine despite the other reivews here to the contrary), heated seats, rear DVD, moonroof (however, 4Runner adjusted to avoid windthrob and Seq one does not), universal remote garage door opener, remote ignition.

Performance, ride and comfort. It is so much smoother riding than my 05 GMC on our crappy freeways. 

Stereo is good as it is a JBL. Transmission shifts smoothly and exterior design is appealing.

Ride, comfort, smooth engine and transmission response. Good seats compared to many new luxury SUVs. 

Navigation!! 3rd seat when needed, radio controls on steering wheel, DVD that we can connect game systems to for long trips, outlets in car just like home for anything.

Really everything!

Navigation system, entertainment system, airbags.

Powerful and smooth engine. Child latch in the third row. Huge sunroof. Front and back A/C. Loads of room inside. General looks of the vehicle. Toyota reliability and fit and finish.

Our sound system and navigational system was absolutely amazing!

I love the color of our car... Arctic Frost!

Center row captain chairs.

Easy to park. Turns very well. Even with all those miles I know it won't break down.

Quiet ride, VSC/TRAC, smooth shifting, rear window rolls down, great stock stereo system, ergonomic cluster layout.
