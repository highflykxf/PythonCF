TIght construction, handling, acceleration, fuel economy (avg 26.4 mpg so far in mostly city driving and that's with a 3.5L V6).

My favorite feature is the rear DVD player. It definitely keeps my kids quiet on long trips. It gets lots of compliments from other drivers! I also like how roomy the trunk is.
