Ride height, backup camera, power, sound system, interior appearence, over all sense that everything was well thought out before being implemented

Styling, interior and exterior. Power lift-gate-which goes all the way up, power seats, climate control system, seat & back warmers, HK sound system, xenon lights, sound dampening, MP3 connection, rear-view camera, and power folding mirrors, etc. I like the 19? tires over the 17??much more stable. 

Back up camera, sound system, cargo space

Adjustable contour seats. High torque. Fuel efficiency. Navigation system. Luxury feel. Quality build.

iPod integration, power liftgate, drive, overall comfort, gorgeous looks

Comfort, ride, handling, cargo space

The premium sound system is great as is the air conditioning system.

Comfort, ride, performance, MPG, SIRIUS radio and a outstanding stereo system. The AMG package really makes this vehicle stand out from the rest but has a premium price for what you get.

Smooth highway performance. 8 speaker audio system. Sirius radio. 19" wheels. Back-up camera

Diesel! Keyless go. Satellite is cool, so many settings on the dash and nav screen available. Love the shifter, but it does take some getting used to. Mileage so far is about 25 mixed, wonderful for this SUV. IPod integration is wife's favorite feature.

Relaxing and refined interior. Command center. ipod integration. Sport and lighting package.

Low engine and road noise. The ride is very smooth and comfortable. The handling for a vehicle of this type is very nimble. It's a joy to drive. 

Backup camera. Built in navigation. Sirius radio

Style, fuel mileage, ride

I really like the command module and the bluetooth hands free phone option. The navigation and back up camera are very nice as is the satellite radio. The controls took me a little while to adapt to after having driven two American SUV's as my last two vehicles, e.g. Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon Denali

The comfort and ride of this suv is better than my Lexus RX 330. Moreover, I don't see ten more every ten blocks like I would see another RX 

AMG sports package

Effortless acceleration, adaptive HID headlights, extremely comfortable and supportive seats

GPS, sos, memory seats, bluetooth, heat/cool option turn off for back seat. Front heating.

Engine, transmission, dual exhausts, big brakes. 

Diesel, mileage, build quality, handling, comfort, dealer experience, pretty much everything.

The performance is unmatched. Porsche Turbo S is its only competitor and that's $10-15k more.

DVD navigation system. Exterior and interior design.

Clean turbo diesel responsiveness and gas mileage. AWD hadndles and rides like a luxury sedan.

You have to love the way this car drives and performs, it moves like a charm. It is difficult to believe that you are moving over 5000lbs while steering and manuevering.Satellite radio is fantastic, as is Teleaide and the safety that is Mercedes makes it worth the price! My dealership was the best!

Power and efficiency of this quiet, high tech diesel drivetrain. The harman/kardon stereo and satellite radio. Good sounding blues anywhere! The optional fully adjustable leather seats. Impeccable fit and finish - this vehicle is made in Alabama, USA. 

MPG is averaging 25 total. Handles very well on rural roads, excellent sound system (upgraded), and the wife says more comfortable than the Lexus.

The audio system is awesome. The navigational screen and DVD info amaze me with all that's available. Overall the entire vehicle has impressed me with all of the bells and whistles. The heated seats are a necessity in the northeast here. Well laid out instrument cluster.

Diesel, diesel, diesel. Quality workmanship. Comfort and safety. Life-of-the vehicle roadside assistance.

Sporty feel, great mileage and performance. Creature comforts of a supple (sheepskins) and quiet cabin, even at 80+MPH! Satellite radio, vivid color back-up camera, power auto folding mirrors, AMG sport package! 

A real head turner, and a sleeper for the unlightened that are dispatched into the dust with ease. 

All controls located on the steering wheel. NAV/Radio large screen and I truly enjoy the CD player is located in the front of the car and not in back of the SUV. 

Power tailgate. Easy folding rear seats. Great gas mileage for a middle size SUV. 

Command, navigation, bluetooth. CD changer, IPOD interface. Steering wheel controls. Sirius radio. Power sunroof, power liftgate. Logic7 digital surround sound. Hands free communication system. Power folding and dimming mirrors, rear view camera. Power seat functions, heated seats. Bi-xenon tracking headlights.



The diesel engine is quiet with no black soot like older diesels. It offers 19-20 mpg around town and 24-25 mpg on the road. 24 mpg at 75 mph and 25 mpg at 60 mph. Bluetooth is a must. NAV/radio works great, much improved over older models. Ride is smooth and 7 speed transmission is exceptional.

Rear gate open and close by remote. Center console grab rails hold my bride's purse from the eventual floor tumble. Comfortable seating. Heater warm at start up. Multi function buttons on wheel control most everything.

Very stable cornering. Power tailgate. Bluetooth. Good power

Power of the V-8, Satellite radio. Very smooth ride.

What else but the fact that it is a Mercedes? Love the seat, so comfy. The automatic liftgate is very cool.



The look, the drive, the handling.

Quiet cabin all speeds/surfaces. Responsive/accurate steering. Best in luxury SUV class, any price. Fast and responsive V6 286HP. Good overall mileage (for me) at 19.5 MPG mixed driving. Sirus radio.
