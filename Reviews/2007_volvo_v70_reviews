Styling. I like the battery and fuses in trunk as a safety improvement. The dual temp control is a nice feature since different folks like different temps. The additional 12v outlets and 6 cup holders is great. The 3 person memory electric seat is a plus. Tire pressue monitoring is excellent idea.

Visibility and safety.

Wagon concept and size of trunk. Controls and seats. Several safety features. 

Comfortable seats and reasonable performance.



Garage pass key holder, Windshield passholder and other smart features

The optional top line stability control feature was big reason for purchase. The auto wipers that sense rain are nice. I got the home link system which is great for my gated community. Seats are very comfortable and adjust easily, as does steering column tilt and telescope.
