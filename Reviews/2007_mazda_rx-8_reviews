High revving rotary, outstanding handling, high quality interior.

Great handling. Great sound system. Great comfort for a small sports car.

You just need to test drive to understand the driving feel. If you need four seats, buy this. If you can get away with two, buy an Elise or a Porsche.

Overall look and handling, bose sound system, 4 doors.



Interior quality and comfort, handling.

Looks faster then it is (someday it will be faster then it looks ;-) sound of the engine. Feel of the steering (you can throw this thing through corners!) with traction control off it just flows around corners powersliding!

Looks, handling, overall drive.

Nimble, good steering feedback, easy to control. The interior is well placed designed and has a European feel found in $50k cars. Digital speedo is great! You learn to love it and miss it in other cars. I love to rev it to redline and feel the hop in the next gear. 

Rotary smoothness, precise handling, interior design, keyless entry and ignition, exotic exterior styling, low price, Bose audio, rarely seen in area.

Rotory engine! 4 doors! Handling! The fact that I can race it (once the warranty is up).

Handling, fun to drive, cool looking.

The seats are great, it corners flat as if tied to the road, the sound of the high revving rotary engine, the styling, the ride, the 300 watt Bose stereo.

Sporty look and drive.

Great pick up. good looking body style and lines.

Interior design.

Keyless entry and ignition.
