Price, comfort...

Versatility, mileage, dependability

The stow and go seats, powerful engine, smooth and stable ride, automatic doors, and the video and six-disk changer. 

The storage areas. Seems everywhere I look there is a place to put stuff. The great thing about it is that no one can see my gear when looking at my van. Great facture far not being broken into.



Very good price compared to the toyata I almost purchased. But for a difference of about 5k. I stuck with the Dodge. Design is quite good, but not that much of an improvement over my 2000 Voyager, although I love the way the seats fold down. Took a long time to get that. 

Design, smoothness in driving, economic in price as well maintanance 

Stow and Go package; still offered cassette tape with CD on this

Sirius radio. Stow and go

Interior, seating and exterior styling. Easy to drive.

Ride is smooth. Quality is way better than imported brands

Basic design, prefer smaller wheel base for parking in city. Built-in Bluetooth 

Outside of the tranny issue i find the van performs great. rear seats removal is a big improvement from the last van I had which was a 1999. 

 Can't say, as I've been upset ever sense drving it off the lot.

Space, maneuverabilty, four comfortable bucket seats. Low price for what it offers. Sirius radio is a nice bonus.

Tight turning radius on short wheel base. Very quiet ride

The stow away is fab. The new reverseable seating with table is also. You can make a great deal. Do try for side rear air bags, if they are not standard yet. 

The versatality of the quick change Stow and Go seats makes this both a cargo or passenger van. I liked the remote door openers for shoppers with hands full.

Cruise control lets me rest feet from pedals

Stow and Go, DVD player in the dash with our family is great (not on the unit like GM) Sirius radio for 1 year is neat too

DVD player, rides nice
