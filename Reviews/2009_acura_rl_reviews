Nav system with live traffic, Vented seats, nice looking dash, excellent quality, extremely quite. Voice control works great!

The Hard Drive navigation system can reset my destinations on the fly, give a three day forecast, reroute my course in the event of inclement weather or traffic stoppage and even make or change my service appointments for me! Who needs touch screen while driving? It even recharges my Ipod with USB!

Nice chassis dynamics, turns great at any speed. Navigation system is stellar. Nice steering wheel. Comfortable seats.

Great seats, radio, ride, easy to understand and operate controls, quiet.

Paddle shifters, HID headlights and road handling.

Bullet proof quality from top to bottom

The driver interface on all levels exceeds every other car I've tried. Every aspect of the car can be customized and is at your command if you take the time to learn the protocol.

Rear cam, door sensor, Bose radio, color (Jade), power seat driver/ passenger.

Technology Package

Technology in this car is incredible. Best navigation system yet, puts BMW to shame. Seats are as comfortable as Lexus with cool and heated ventilation. AWd is the best I ever driven with a great suspension, stereo is top notch.

Handling, technology, driving excitement, build quality

Interior comfort and quality materials. On screen iPod integration. Acceleration and handling. Lets me drive in great luxury without screaming to everyone that I own a $50,000 car. Not everyone will value that, but if you do, then you'll know what I'm talking about.

surround sound; awd handling; improved low end torque; sporty look

Flawless interior, quiet, great radio, stunning rear end, more power and torque over last model, cooled seats. 18 inch wheels look great. Very comfortable for 4 people. Could be driven coast-to-coast with no muss, no fuss.
